      <p>Ecological interactions between aboveground and belowground biodiversity have received many attentions in the recent decades. Although soil biodiversity declined with the decrease of plant diversity, many previous studies found plant species identities were more important than plant diversity in controlling soil biodiversity. This study focused on the responses of soil biodiversity to the altering of plant functional groups, namely overstory and understory vegetations, rather than plant diversity gradient. We conducted an experiment by removing overstory and/or understory vegetation to compare their effects on soil microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and nematode diversities in eucalyptus monocultures. Our results indicated that both overstory and understory vegetations could affect soil microbial PLFA and nematode diversities, which manifested as the decrease in Shannon–Wiener diversity index (
       <italic>
        H′
       </italic>) and Pielou evenness index (J) and the increase in Simpson dominance index (λ) after vegetation removal. Soil microclimate change explained part of variance of soil biodiversity indices. Both overstory and understory vegetations positively correlated with soil microbial PLFA and nematode diversities. In addition, the alteration of soil biodiversity might be due to a mixing effect of bottom-up control and soil microclimate change after vegetation removal in the studied plantations. Given the studied ecosystem is common in humid subtropical and tropical region of the world, our findings might have great potential to extrapolate to large scales and could be conducive to ecosystem management and service.</p>

    <p>Biodiversity plays a crucial role in ecosystem function and processes not only because of its importance in production of food, fiber and fuel, but also because of its roles in ground water replenishment, flooding controls, prevention of soil erosion and ecological invasion, influences on restoration succession, and so on

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Loreau1">

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Tilman1">

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Wardle1">
      [10]
     </xref>. In one hand, plants play a key role in determining soil biota because plants are the main food sources (i.e. leaf litter, dead roots and root exudates) to soil biota, which may exert a bottom-up control on soil organisms. In another hand, soil biota may affect aboveground plant diversity and productivity through influencing nutrient cycling and distribution, and damaging plants by parasites, pathogens and herbivores

    <p>Plant functional groups (PFG) or plant functional types (PFT) are assemblages of species with similar roles in ecosystem processes by responding in similar ways to multiple environmental factors 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Lavorel1">
      [13]
     </xref>. They are necessary devices for reducing the complexity of plant community and often uncharted characteristics of species diversity in function and structure when attempting to project the nature and function of species assemblages into future environments 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Woodward1">
      [14]
     </xref>. However, due to the diverse aims of different researches, diverse plant functional groups are chosen to simplify the plant community, i.e. legumes, forbs/herbs, C3/C4-plants, overstory vegetation, and understory vegetation.</p> 
    <p>Vegetation removal has been frequently used to explore how specific plant species or functional groups affect ecosystem processes and functions. Overstory removal (timber harvest) has been a common forest management practice which also provides opportunities for soil ecologists to study relationships between overstory tree species and soil biota. In general, overstory removal suppresses soil biota such as bacteria, fungus, nematodes, and microarthropods in the long run

     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Forge1">
      [17]
     </xref>. However, there are studies which reported overstory removal had slight or non-significant impacts on soil biota, especially in the short term

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Wu1">
      [19]
     </xref>. To date, less attention has been paid to understory vegetation in terms of their impacts on soil biota, probably because the biomass and economic value of the understory are less than overstory tree species. Understory vegetation is an important component in many forest ecosystems worldwide

      [24]
     </xref>. However, how understory vegetation affects the soil biodiversity has never been studied before.</p> 
    <p>In the present study, we monitored the soil microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and nematode diversity after overstory and/or understory removal in eucalyptus monocultures in South China. The eucalyptus species is 
     <italic>
      Eucalyptus urophylla
     </italic>, which is a fast-grow species and has been widely planted for reforestation in South China 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Wu1">
      [19]
     </xref>. The understory vegetation was dominated by 
     <italic>
      Dicranopteris dichotoma
     </italic>, a common fern species in humid subtropical and tropical region 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Zhao1">
      [20]
     </xref>. Other common understory species included 
     <italic>
      Miscanthus sinensis
     </italic> and 
     <italic>
      Rhodomyrtus tomentosa
     </italic>. Thus, the diversity of overstory and understory vegetations is not high in the studied ecosystems. Therefore, we did not calculate the plant diversity. In this experiment, overstory and understory vegetations were removed separately or in combination to assess their impacts on soil microbial PLFA profile and nematode community. Both 
     <italic>
      E. urophylla
     </italic> and 
     <italic>
      D. dichotoma
     </italic> are high in biomass and primary productivity 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Zhao1">
      [20]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Chen1">
      [25]
     </xref>. Previous study, conducted at the same site as this study, reported that understory removal showed stronger effects on soil microbial community structure, and abundance of nematode and microarthropod than overstory removal 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Zhao1">

     </xref>. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study was that the effects of understory removal on soil microbial and nematode diversity were greater than overstory removal. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the contributions of the understory and/or overstory vegetation to soil microbial and nematode diversity. Our analyses also intend to address the question of which factors (i.e. resource and soil microclimate) affected soil biodiversity after altering of aboveground vegetations.</p>

       E. urophylla
      </italic> monoculture plantations. In September 2009, we established an experiment with a split-plot design. Within each plantation, main plots (15×15-m) were overstory trees treatment (present or removed) and subplots were understory treatment (present or removed). In total, there were four treatments in each plantation, namely, control with intact overstory and understory (CK), understory removal (UR), overstory tree removal (TR) and all-plant removal (PR). The trees were cut with an electrical saw leaving 5 cm stumps aboveground. All woody debris was removed from the plots immediately after vegetation was removed. The shoots of all understory plants were removed manually with the aid of a machete. Trenches were created around each main-plot and subplot to prevent the interactions of the roots from other subplots and to prevent the exchange of nutrients among subplots. Germination of the stumps (TR plots) and understory vegetation (UR and PR subplots) were monthly removed.</p>

Soil cores (2.5 cm in diameter, 5 cm in length) were taken at 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths from eight locations selected randomly in each subplot within each plantation. Eight cores of the same depth from each subplot were combined to form one composite sample; there were three replicate samples for each treatment. The surface litter was removed carefully when soil sample was taken.</p> 
     <p>Soil water content (SWC %, g of water per 100 g dry soil) was measured by oven-drying for 48 h at 105°C. Soil temperature was recorded every 2 h with the DS1922L temperature logger iButtons (Dallas Semiconductor Corp., Dallas, TX) from September 2009 to October 2010.

Briefly, the soil was extracted in a one-phase extraction mixture containing chloroform:methanol:phosphate buffer (1∶2∶0.8 v/v/v), with the amount of phosphate buffer corrected to account for existing soil water content mixture of chloroform:methanol:citrate buffer (1∶2∶0.8 v/v/v). After extraction the phospholipids were separated from neutral lipids and glycolipids on solid phase extraction columns, 0.50 g Si (Supelco, Inc., Bellefonte, Penn). Polar lipids were eluted and were then subjected to mild alkaline methanolysis. Resulting fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were separated, quantified, and identified using capillary gas chromatography (GC). Qualitative and quantitative fatty acid analyses were performed using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and the MIDI Sherlock Microbial Identification System (MIDI Inc., Newark, DE, USA). Concentrations of each PLFA were calculated relative to 19∶0 internal standard concentrations. The following PLFAs were considered to be of soil microbial origin: i15∶0, a15∶0, 15∶0, i16∶0, 16∶1ω7, i17∶0, a17∶0, 17∶0, cy17∶0, cy19∶0 18∶2ω6,9, 16∶1ω5, 18∶1ω7, and 18∶1ω9

     <title>Contributions of Understory or Overstory Vegetations to Soil Biodiversity</title> 
     <p>Apparently, all plant removal showed strongest suppression on soil microbial and nematode diversity in the present study. In addition, both understory removal and overstory removal reduced soil microbial PLFA and nematode diversities, which was inconsistent with our hypothesis that the effects of understory removal on soil biodiversity might be more powerful than overstory removal. Consistent with our finding, many studies reported that all plant removal had significant negative influence on soil biota in forest and grassland ecosystem

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Zhao4">
       [32]
      </xref>. Our previous study at the same site reported that understory removal had stronger negative effects on abundances and compositions of soil biota (microbes and nematodes) than overstory removal 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Zhao1">
       [20]
      </xref>. That was why our hypotheses stated as understory had greater contributions on soil biodiversity than overstory. Contrary to our hypotheses, our analyses clearly showed that the overstory vegetation impacted soil biodiversity too. In addition, overstory removal rather than understory removal significantly reduced amount of total PLFAs in 5–10 cm soil depth during the study (
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085513.s002">
       Appendix S2
      </xref>). There are many studies focused on the effects of overstory removal on soil biota because canopy tree harvest is a common forest management practice. For example, fifteen years after harvesting, diversity and structure of soil bacterial and fungal communities remained apparently altered by harvesting disturbances; and three fungi taxa (i.e. ectomycorrhizal fungi, saprobic taxa, and ascomycetes) and actinomycetes were most sensitive to harvesting disturbance in sub-boreal spruce forest in BC, Canada 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Hartmann1">
       [15]
      </xref>. Both stem-only and whole-tree harvesting decreased microarthropod abundance in a temperate mixed conifer–hardwood stand

       [34]
      </xref>. However, these studies usually focused on size of populations and structure of communities of soil biota; there is no mention of how soil biodiversity responses to overstory removal in these studies. Furthermore, most of the studies did not clearly state whether understory was remained un-harvesting or not when overstory was harvested. In addition, understory vegetation is important ecological component that plays important roles in driving forest ecosystem functions and processes

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Nilsson1">
       [21]
      </xref>; however, it is usually overlooked in the previous studies. Several studies reported the relationship between understory vegetation and aboveground biodiversity (e.g., birds, reptiles, arthropods)

      </italic> of soil microbial PLFA profile might indicate the linkage between overstory vegetation and soil rare microbial taxa. The promotive effect of overstory removal on λ of soil microbial PLFA profile might indicate the linkage between overstory vegetation and soil abundant microbial taxa. Therefore, overstory vegetation might link to both the rare and abundant taxa of soil microbial organisms. Although no significant effect of overstory removal on 
      <italic>
       H′
      </italic> and λ of nematode community, overstory removal increased the Pielou evenness index (J) of nematode community, which implied that the abundance of nematode taxa did not differ from each other as much as their abundance before overstory removal. The likely reason might be that the rare species disappeared and were not collected after overstory removal, which eliminated the weight of the rare taxa to Pielou evenness index. In the similar way, understory vegetation linked to both abundant and rare taxa at 0–5 cm soil depth.</p>

     <title>Factor(s) that Affect Soil Biodiversity</title> 
     <p>Plant diversity may influence soil biodiversity via two main ways. High plant diversity may (1) enhance net primary productivity and (2) lead to high food resources (e.g. litter and root exudates) diversity, and subsequently supports high soil biodiversity

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Wu1">
       [19]
      </xref>, which in turn may change soil biodiversity. The bottom-up control opinion was also supported by the differential responses of soil biodiversity at different depths to overstory and understory vegetation. Overstory removal decreased soil biodiversity at both 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm soil depths while understory removal mainly suppressed soil biodiversity at 0–5 cm soil layer. The reason might be that the overstory 
      <italic>
       E. urophylla
      </italic> is a deep-rooted species and the dominant understory 
      <italic>
       D. dichotoma
      </italic> is a shallow-rooted fern species with fibrous root on stolons. The deep-rooted species removal might reduce the availability of soil carbon and nutrients for soil biota at deeper soil depth. Previous studies reported that vegetation removal reduced fine root biomass in eucalyptus plantations in the studied area 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Wu1">
       [19]
      </xref>, 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Chen1">
       [25]
      </xref>. Unfortunately, none of these studies differentiated either overstory or understory roots from the total plant roots and they did not report the composition of root at different soil depths.</p> 
     <p>In the present study, soil microclimate (especially soil temperature) explained a certain proportion of variability of soil biodiversity indices. Therefore, soil microclimate change that induced by vegetation removal probably contributed to the alteration of soil biodiversity. Supporting this hypothesis, growth temperature affected the cellular fatty acids composition of sulphate-reducing bacteria that were of marine origin 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085513-Knneke1">
       [46]
      </xref>. In addition, our own data revealed that vegetation removal increased soil temperature and decreased soil water content in the later stage of the study, and the effect of understory removal on soil microclimate was greater than overstory removal.</p> 
     <p>The negative effects of vegetation removal on soil biodiversity also gradually increased over time, which indicated that alterations in bottom-up control and soil microclimate induced by vegetation removal were time-dependent. Firstly, vegetation removal significantly reduced the food resource for soil biota. However, the decomposition of the remained soil residuals (e.g., roots and litter) is time consuming. Therefore, the soil biodiversity declined with the exhaustion of soil residuals. Secondly, the soil microclimate changes that induced by vegetation removal were from March to October (mainly in wet season) in 2010, which was overlapped with the significant declines of soil biodiversity in this study. Thus, the seasonal variation of soil microclimate might be another reason for the time-dependent response of soil biodiversity to vegetation removal.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title> 
    <p>Here we reported the first study designed to explore the relationship between overstory and understory vegetations and soil biodiversity. Our results showed that both overstory and understory vegetations correlated with soil biodiversity of Eucalyptus plantations in southern China. Interaction between overstory vegetation and soil biodiversity might be due to its high-biomass property that exerts a bottom-up control on soil biodiversity in the studied plantations. Interaction between understory vegetation and soil biodiversity might due to the mixing effect of vegetation identity and soil microclimate change after understory removal that drives soil biodiversity in the studied plantations. Eucalyptus has been extensively planted in many tropical and subtropical regions
