      <p>Habitat loss is the main driver of the current biodiversity crisis, a landscape-scale process that affects the survival of spatially-structured populations. Although it is well-established that species responses to habitat loss can be abrupt, the existence of a biodiversity threshold is still the cause of much controversy in the literature and would require that most species respond similarly to the loss of native vegetation. Here we test the existence of a biodiversity threshold, i.e. an abrupt decline in species richness, with habitat loss. We draw on a spatially-replicated dataset on Atlantic forest small mammals, consisting of 16 sampling sites divided between forests and matrix habitats in each of five 3600-ha landscapes (varying from 5% to 45% forest cover), and on an 
       <italic>
        a priori
       </italic> classification of species into habitat requirement categories (forest specialists, habitat generalists and open-area specialists). Forest specialists declined abruptly below 30% of forest cover, and spillover to the matrix occurred only in more forested landscapes. Generalists responded positively to landscape heterogeneity, peaking at intermediary levels of forest cover. Open area specialists dominated the matrix and did not spillover to forests. As a result of these distinct responses, we observed a biodiversity threshold for the small mammal community below 30% forest cover, and a peak in species richness just above this threshold. Our results highlight that cross habitat spillover may be asymmetrical and contingent on landscape context, occurring mainly from forests to the matrix and only in more forested landscapes. Moreover, they indicate the potential for biodiversity thresholds in human-modified landscapes, and the importance of landscape heterogeneity to biodiversity. Since forest loss affected not only the conservation value of forest patches, but also the potential for biodiversity-mediated services in anthropogenic habitats, our work indicates the importance of proactive measures to avoid human-modified landscapes to cross this threshold.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p> Loss of habitats, especially the conversion of tropical forests into agricultural and urban areas, is the main driver of the biodiversity crisis we are observing today [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
      1
     </xref>]. Around 43% of the terrestrial world surface has been disturbed and the original vegetation converted into anthropogenic new habitats [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
      2
     </xref>]. In tropical countries as Brazil, one third of the land has been converted and agricultural frontiers are still expanding [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
      3
     </xref>]. Extinction rates in this century are estimated to be more than two orders of magnitude higher than background rates [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
      4
     </xref>], and can soon be much higher if models of state shifts, which predict abrupt changes in ecological systems, are correct [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
      2
     </xref>]. </p> 
    <p> While habitat loss is clearly a landscape scale process, affecting the survival and dispersal of spatially structured populations or metapopulations, most of our knowledge on its effects comes from studies conducted at the patch scale [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
      5
     </xref>]. Advances in metapopulation [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
      6
     </xref>] and landscape ecology [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
      7
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
      8
     </xref>] modeling suggest, however, that this approach is not adequate since responses at the patch scale are contingent on two main aspects of landscape context: the permeability of the newly-created anthropogenic habitats (i.e. the type and quality of the matrix surrounding habitat patches) [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
      9
     </xref>], and the amount of remaining habitat at the landscape scale [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
      7
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
      10
     </xref>]. The influence of the amount of habitat at the landscape scale is linked to a series of non-linear relationships between this variable and habitat characteristics at the patch scale [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
      5
     </xref>]. In simulated fragmented landscapes, the size of the largest patch decreases drastically below 60% of remaining habitat; the number of patches peaks at around 30% of remaining habitat; and the distance among patches increases exponentially around 10-20% of remaining habitat [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
      5
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
      7
     </xref>]</p> 
    <p>These structural landscape thresholds are expected to lead to species extinction thresholds, with species suddenly disappearing from all patches in a landscape. Both modeling [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
      7
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
      10
     </xref>–
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
      12
     </xref>] and empirical [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
      10
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
      13
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
      14
     </xref>] studies suggest extinction thresholds are observed below 30% of remaining habitat, and thus would be linked to the exponential increase in the distance among patches at 10-20% of remaining habitat. However, the existence of a biodiversity or species richness threshold would require that most species in a community respond similarly to the loss of native vegetation, and despite some empirical evidence in favor of such a threshold [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
      10
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
      14
     </xref>], it is still the cause of much debate and controversy in the literature [e.g. [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
      13
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">
      15
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">
      16
     </xref>].</p> 
    <p> Much of this controversy comes from the fact that species in a community usually have different habitat requirements and thus are likely to respond differently to the loss of native vegetation and the expansion of anthropogenic habitats [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">
      17
     </xref>]. Indeed, species specific responses to habitat disturbances are the rule in patch scale studies comparing communities across distinct habitats [e.g. [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">
      18
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">
      19
     </xref>]. It is thus clear that evaluations of biodiversity thresholds caused by the loss of native vegetation should take into account both species habitat requirements and the response of species to the main anthropogenic habitats in the matrix. </p> 
    <p> As far as we are aware, there are no empirical studies that sampled simultaneously both the native vegetation and the main anthropogenic habitat in the matrix across a gradient of native vegetation loss at the landscape scale, considering species habitat requirements 
     <italic>
      a priori
     </italic>. However, from the modeling studies mentioned previously we can predict at least three different responses to the loss of native forest at the landscape scale: (1) forest specialist species, which should not occur in the matrix, should go extinct below the threshold of 30% of forest cover given the exponential increase in the distance among patches at ~10-20% of remaining forest; (2) generalist species, which should occur both in forest and matrix, should be more common at around 30% of forest cover, where the number of patches is greatest and thus is landscape structural heterogeneity; and (3) open-area specialist should occur only in the matrix, and may be able to eventually invade depauperated forest patches in landscapes below the 30% threshold, where forest specialist should have gone extinct.</p> 
    <p> In this paper we use a spatially replicated dataset (five 3600-ha landscapes ranging from 5% to 45% of remaining forest, each sampled in eight forest and eight matrix sites) and an 
     <italic>
      a priori
     </italic> classification of species into habitat requirement categories (forest specialists, habitat generalists and open-area specialists) to evaluate these hypotheses on how species are expected to respond to the loss of native vegetation at the landscape scale. We chose as a model system the small mammal community of the Atlantic Forest. Small mammals, the most diverse group of mammals in the Neotropics [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">
      20
     </xref>], include species with different habitat requirements [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">
      21
     </xref>], and are good indicators of anthropogenic disturbances, displaying rapid and distinct responses to habitat fragmentation [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
      10
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">
      18
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">
      22
     </xref>]. The Atlantic Forest, once one of the largest rainforests of the Americas, has been reduced to roughly 12% of its original cover [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">
      23
     </xref>], and nowadays is considered to be one of the five most critical hotspots of biodiversity on a global scale [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">
      24
     </xref>]. </p> 
    <p>We thus aim at helping to advance our knowledge on the existence of a biodiversity threshold, which should depend on how many species in a community belongs to each of the groups with distinct habitat requirements and distinct responses to the loss of native vegetation. Our results suggest that despite differential responses to habitat loss among forest specialist, habitat generalist and open-area specialist species, a strong biodiversity threshold can be observed across fragmented landscapes.</p>

     <p>Trapping, handling and specimens collection were approved by IBAMA - Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis (license number 12023-3). Because our study involved capture and handling of small mammals in the field, it did not receive an approval in advance from the Committee for Animal Use of the Institute of Biology -UFBA (Comissão de Ética no Uso de Animais – CEUA, http://www.ceua.ufba.br), which only requires approval for studies on vertebrates that include experimentation (e.g. maintenance in captivity, injection of drugs, or surgery). However, retrospective approval was subsequently obtained from the UFBA CEUA (approval number 13/2013). Trapping, handling and euthanasia methods followed the guidelines of the American Society of Mammalogists Animal Care and Use Committee. No in vivo procedures were carried out prior to humane euthanasia of animals executed by gradual hypoxia with CO2. The specimens collected are deposited at the Museum of Zoology, UFBA, in compliance with national laws (IN 154/IBAMA). We did not sample either protected areas or species.</p>

     <p> From the study region, we sampled five landscapes of 6 x 6 km (3600 ha) varying in the amount of remaining forest (5%, 15%, 25%, 35% and 45%), in all of which altitude was less than 300 m, forest remnants were in mid to advanced stages of regeneration and the matrix was dominated by open areas. The study region was divided in a grid of 6 x 6 km landscapes. For all these landscapes, and larger surrounding areas of 18 x 18 km, we calculated forest cover, the size of the largest forest patch (Largest Patch Index; [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">
       29
      </xref>]), and the percentage of the matrix that is non-forested and non-urban based on recent satellite images (2005-2008) from the “Atlas dos Remanescentes Florestais da Mata Atlântica” (www.sosma.org.br and

       <underline>

We controlled both forest cover and the size of the largest forest patch in the surrounding, larger areas, since both could act as source areas, thus considering only the 6 x 6 km landscapes where forest cover and the size of the largest forest patches were larger than the observed in the surroundings (18 x 18 km). We also controlled the permeability of the matrix by considering only landscapes where at least 80% of the matrix presented low permeability, with vegetation height less than 2 m (thus not computing urban areas, tree plantations, such as cacao, pines, eucalyptus, and rubber trees, and young secondary forests). We then chose the sampled landscapes by randomizing their spatial distribution to avoid correlation between geographical position and percentage of forest cover (

Each of the five landscapes was divided into grids of 100 plots of 600 x 600 m classified as either forest or matrix plots. We then randomly chose 8 plots of each type (16 per landscape) to locate our sampling sites, which were checked in the field to guarantee that forests corresponded to secondary forest in mid to advanced stages of regeneration and the matrix to non-urban, open areas with vegetation height less than 2 m. We also ensured there was a minimum distance of 30 m from all sampling sites to forest edge. </p> 
     <p>Our sampling is spatially rather than temporally replicated, and was designed to provide a comparable, standardized snap-shot of the small mammal communities across landscapes with different amounts of forest cover. However, we controlled for temporal variation by sampling all landscapes within the same season and year, and all sites within each landscape simultaneously (see below).</p>

     <p> We sampled small non-volant mammals (rodents and marsupials) in all 80 sites (8 forest and 8 matrix sites in each of the five landscapes) using both pitfall traps (35 l) and medium-sized live traps similar to Sherman (10 x 10 x 30 cm) and Tomahawk (15 x 17 x 45 cm). In each sampling site we established two 100-m long trap lines, 5 m apart from each other: one containing 10 equidistant pitfall traps connected by a 50-cm high plastic drift fence, and the other containing 20 equidistant live traps on the ground (10 of each type). We baited the traps with a mixture of peanut butter, sunflowers seeds, oat grains, palm-oil and sardines. We conducted one capture session of eight days in each site, totaling 240 traps x night per site, 3840 traps x night per landscape and 19200 traps x night in the whole study. All sites and landscapes were sampled in the dry season, between January to March and September to November of 2011. The sixteen sites in a landscape were sampled simultaneously and thus the sampling of each landscape took around 10 days. </p>

    <p>In forests, forest specialist species were the dominant assemblage, with the highest abundance, alpha diversity and gamma diversity, followed by habitat generalist species (

     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082369-g003">

As a result of the combination of these distinct responses, abundance, alpha diversity and gamma diversity of the whole small mammal community in the matrix were similar to the observed in forests: the three variables were generally lower in the two (instead of the three as in forests) least forested landscapes (5 and 15%) compared to the three most (25, 35 and 45%) forested landscapes, and the three variables (instead of only gamma diversity as in forest) peaked at the 35% forest cover landscape (

    <p>Finally, considering all three habitat requirement categories and both habitat types together, the small mammal community presented a clear threshold across the gradient of forest loss, with both abundance and alpha diversity being consistently higher in the two most forested (35 and 45%) compared to the two less forested (5 and 15%) landscapes, with intermediate values in the 25 % forest cover landscape (

Below, we first discuss the differential responses to forest loss among small mammal assemblages with different habitat requirements (forest specialists, habitat generalists and open-area specialists). We then discuss the observed species spillover between forests and anthropogenic habitats, and the observed different ecological thresholds across the gradient of habitat loss.

      </xref>].</p> 
     <p>Forest specialists were much more common in forests than in anthropogenic habitats, as expected. They occurred in the matrix, but only in forested landscapes above the 30% forest cover threshold, i.e. in landscapes where they are common and abundant in forests. This finding corroborates the importance of “cross habitat spillover” in fragmented landscapes [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">
       32
      </xref>], and indicates that for forest specialists this process depends on landscape forest cover and thus on the overall size of source populations. </p> 
     <p>Habitat generalist species, in contrast, apparently responded to another structural landscape threshold - the increased landscape structural heterogeneity - associated with the peak in the number of forest patches in landscapes at around 30% of remaining habitat [

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">
       37

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">
       38
      </xref>]. </p> 
     <p>It is important to mention, though, that the pattern of increased abundance and diversity of generalists in intermediately-forested landscapes was most evident in forests, while in the matrix habitat generalists were most common and diverse in more forested landscapes, as forest specialists. Therefore, even considering habitat generalists, the matrix of highly deforested landscapes supports very few species, with potential consequences for ecological functioning in the anthropogenic habitats of these degraded landscapes (see below). </p> 
     <p>Open-area specialist species, on the other hand, were the dominant assemblage in the matrix, as expected. Interestingly, they did not spillover to forests, irrespective of landscape forest cover, indicating a resistance of forests to invasion [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">
       39
      </xref>] even in highly deforested landscapes where forest patches harbor extremely poor communities. Moreover, their gamma diversity was highest in intermediately-forested, rather than highly deforested landscapes, indicating that open-area specialists, although not invading forest patches, may benefit from landscape structural heterogeneity. Finally, their abundance and alpha diversity did not increase with forest loss, meaning that an expansion of open areas did not lead to the propagation of the populations of these species as it has been previously hypothesized [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">
       40
      </xref>]. However, it is important to notice that we did not sample highly forested landscapes, where open-area specialist species may not be able to persist. Only in these highly forested landscapes, where the matrix comprises less than 30% of the landscape (i.e. &gt; 70% forest cover landscapes), matrix patches will be very small and isolated. Future studies on the effects of forest loss should extend the amplitude of the forest cover gradient under analysis to test if open-area specialist species are not able to persist in highly forested landscapes, where open-area patches are very small and isolated. </p>

     <title>Cross habitat species spillover across a gradient of forest loss</title> 
     <p>From the distinct responses among habitat requirement categories described above, interesting patterns of species spillover between habitats in fragmented landscapes emerge. We observed that cross habitat species spillover occurred only from forests to the matrix (and not from the matrix to forests), but just in forested landscapes, with potential consequences to ecological functioning and services in anthropogenic habitats. </p> 
     <p>Firstly, benefits from ecosystem services associated with the presence of forest specialist species in anthropogenic habitats should depend on forest cover, occurring only in forested landscapes. In the case of small mammals, for instance, the cross habitat spillover of forest specialist species may result in an important ecosystem service - disease regulation. The main reservoirs of hantavirus causing the fatal Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in humans are usually generalist rodents [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">
       41
      </xref>], and there is evidence for a dilution effect propitiated by the diversity of small mammal communities: the presence of less efficient hosts leads to a lower prevalence of the virus in the main host and a lower risk of disease transmission [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">
       42
      </xref>]. </p> 
     <p>Secondly, there is no evidence in this study of ecological compensation or competitive release in either forests or the matrix of highly deforested landscapes, both harboring poor (less rich and abundant) communities. Again this indicates the potential for losing biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services in highly deforested landscapes, as for example the regulation of pest outbreaks, which are commonly observed in certain types of crops and rodents in South America and other parts of the world [

We showed that a biodiversity threshold, below 30% of habitat, occurs at the landscape scale and in both forests and the matrix, irrespective of differences in responses to forest loss among habitat requirement categories. Although species responded in a variety of ways, not only forest specialists were negatively affected by forest loss, but also habitat generalists (especially inside forests). Moreover, open-area specialists did not proliferate or spillover to forests in highly deforested landscapes. The drastic drop in biodiversity in the entire landscape as well as in forests was observed below 30% of forest cover, as suggested by landscape ecology theory [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
       7
      </xref>]. The threshold in the matrix, however, was observed latter across the gradient of forest loss, around 20% of forest cover. </p> 
     <p> This study also suggests that total gamma diversity peaks just above the biodiversity threshold due to habitat generalist and open-area specialist species. Although this increase has been hypothesized in the literature [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">
       33

       44
      </xref>]. </p> 
     <p> It is important to note, however, that the spatial scale at which such thresholds are observed should depend on the group of organisms under consideration. Since the spatial scale at which organisms are affected by landscape structure depends on their vagility and dispersal ability [

It highlights that the cross habitat species spillover between forests and anthropogenic habitats may be asymmetrical and contingent to landscape context, occurring mainly from forests to the matrix and only in forested landscapes.

     <p>Both the asymmetrical, context dependent cross habitat spillover, and the associated biodiversity threshold suggest that forest loss strongly affects the conservation value of forest patches as well as the potential for biodiversity-mediated services, such as disease regulation and pest control, in anthropogenic habitats. They thus indicate the importance of proactive measures to avoid that human-modified landscapes cross this threshold and the limitation of reactive measures, such as ecological restoration, in highly deforested landscapes [
