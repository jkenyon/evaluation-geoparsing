     <abstract> 
      <p>Across US Great Plains grasslands, a gradient of increasing mean annual precipitation from west to east corresponds to increasing aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and increasing N-limitation. Previous work has shown that there is no increase in net N mineralization rates across this gradient, leading to the question of where eastern prairie grasses obtain the nitrogen to support production. One as-yet unexamined source is soil organic N, despite abundant literature from other ecosystems showing that plants take up dissolved soil organic N. This study measured KCl-extractable dissolved organic N (DON) in surface soils across the grassland productivity gradient. We found that KCl-extractable DON pools increased from west to east. If available to and used by plants, this DON may help explain the high ANPP in the eastern Great Plains. These results suggest a need for future research to determine whether, in what quantities, and in what forms prairie grasses use organic N to support primary production.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title> 
    <p>It has in the past been widely accepted that nitrogen compounds must undergo mineralization – that is, transformation from organic to inorganic forms - to become available to plants 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Stanford1">
      [1]
     </xref>. Yet, in a variety of ecosystems, plants have been shown to take up dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) directly from the soil, as reviewed by 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Schimel1">
      [2]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Neff1">
      [3]
     </xref>. These plant-accessible organic N compounds include amino acids, amino sugars, amino-polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and various purine and pyrimidine compounds 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Schimel1">
      [2]
     </xref>. A new paradigm concerning N cycling has gained acceptance 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Schimel1">
      [2]
     </xref>, in which the rate of depolymerization of organic N polymers into monomers by microbial enzymes, i.e., the production of DON, regulates ecosystem N cycling rather than the rate of N mineralization.</p> 
    <p>The ecological importance of DON acquisition is still unclear in many ecosystems 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Hobbie1">
      [4]
     </xref>, including temperate grasslands. Jones et al. 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Jones1">
      [5]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Jones2">
      [6]
     </xref> suggest that temperate grassland species can take up DON directly from the soil, although it is unclear how important DON is relative to other sources. Knowledge about the magnitude and importance of plant uptake of DON is important for our understanding and predictions of N cycling using models, and for clarifying the dynamics of plant-microbial competition. Understanding the potential for grassland plant use of DON could lead to management strategies that reduce fertilizer use and associated nutrient runoff and pollution while still supporting productive and N-retentive cereal croplands and biofuel-producing grasslands.</p> 
    <p>For grasslands of the United States, the combined results of previous research do not frame a coherent understanding of grassland N cycling. A number of studies have shown grassland plant production to respond to experimental N additions, suggesting that these ecosystems are N–limited 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Dodd1">
      [7]
     </xref>–
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Clenton1">
      [10]
     </xref>; a literature review concluded that although water was an important co-limiter of the semi-arid western grasslands, N-limitation was the rule across the Great Plains 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Hooper1">
      [11]
     </xref>. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) increases with mean annual precipitation from semiarid shortgrass steppe in the west through mixed grass prairie to the subhumid tallgrass prairie in the east 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Sala1">
      [12]
     </xref>. Both the concentration of N in biomass and the litter decomposition rate decrease, and nutrient use efficiency increases, along this precipitation gradient 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Murphy1">
      [13]
     </xref>. Nevertheless, plant N uptake, as indicated by the quantity of N in aboveground production (ANPP-N), increases along this precipitation and production gradient 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-McCulley1">
      [14]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Barrett1">
      [15]
     </xref>. These lines of evidence suggest that the severity of N-limitation increases from west to east.</p> 
    <p>To explain observed patterns of ANPP, simulations of the Century model predict a linear increase of net N mineralization rates with precipitation 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Burke1">
      [16]
     </xref>, yet field studies have reported no west-to-east trend in net N mineralization 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-McCulley1">
      [14]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Barrett1">
      [15]
     </xref>. Total soil N, on the other hand, has been shown to be higher in tallgrass than shortgrass prairie 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Murphy1">
      [13]
     </xref>–

     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Vinton1">
      [17]
     </xref>, suggesting that organic N may play a role in supplying the additional N needed to support eastern tallgrass prairie production. This could explain the discrepancy between model predictions and field studies, as commonly used ecosystem models do not consider the rate of organic N depolymerization or plant uptake of organic N, focusing only on inorganic N mineralization

The two westernmost sites, Shortgrass Steppe (SGS) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) and Arikaree River (ARI) Nature Conservancy site, are located in the drier shortgrass steppe. Two sites, Smokey River (SVR) Nature Conservancy site and a property of Ft. Hays State University (HAYS), were located in the northern mixed grass prairie. The easternmost site was located in the wetter tallgrass prairie, Konza Prairie LTER (KON) (

     <title>Field Sampling</title> 
     <p>At each site, we set up three 25 m long transects within a 100 m radius of each other in undisturbed areas representative of the surrounding vegetation. From June 6–15, 2011, we collected soil cores (10 cm length ×5 cm diameter) from two microsites (under plant canopies and interspaces between plants) and at two depths (0–5 cm and 5–10 cm) at three random locations on each transect, for a total of 180 soil samples (2 microsites ×2 depths ×3 locations ×3 transects ×5 sites). Soils were immediately sieved through a 2 mm mesh and homogenized in a plastic bag.</p> 
     <p>We extracted soils immediately for dissolved N pools, in order to minimize disturbance-induced N transformations associated with delays in processing, and to obtain the most realistic estimates of DON and DIN concentrations possible 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-VanMiegroet1">

      </xref>. A 10 g subsample of field-fresh, sieved, homogenized soil was placed in an extraction cup with 100 mL 2M KCl solution and shaken for 10 minutes. The extraction cups were returned to the laboratory at the University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, to be filtered and frozen within two days of sampling. The remaining soil was air-dried and stored in paper bags until further analysis.</p> 
     <p>We installed one pair of Plant Root Simulator (PRS) resin probes (Western Ag Innovations Inc., Saskatoon, Saskatchewan) per microsite at 10 random locations along each transect (2 microsites ×10 locations ×3 transects ×5 sites  = 300 pairs), to estimate inorganic N supply rate. Each pair consisted of one anion and one cation probe to collect mobile NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, respectively. Probes were inserted into the soil with the adsorption membrane extending from the surface to 5.5 cm depth, and were buried for 30 days from early May to early June 2011. At each site, the probes were removed on the same day as the soil sampling. Probes were sorted into two groups of five pairs of probes from each microsite type. This resulted in two replicate sets of probes per each microsite type per each transect for a total of 60 (2 replicates ×2 microsites ×3 transects ×5 sites) probe sets. Probes were washed in the laboratory with DI water within two days of unearthing and then sent to Western Ag Innovations, Inc. (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan) for inorganic N analysis.</p>

     <p>The eluate from the extraction cups was shaken for 1 hour and filtered in the laboratory using Whatman #1 filter paper and frozen immediately thereafter. For measurement of total KCl-extractable dissolved total N and inorganic N, we thawed the eluate and diluted a 2.5 mL subsample with 17.5 mL DI water. We analyzed total dissolved N on a Shimadzu TOC-V Analyzer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Wood Dale, IL, USA). Dissolved inorganic N was analyzed at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO) using an Alpkem Flow Solution IV Automated wet chemistry system (O.I. Analytical, College Station, TX, USA). We estimated KCl-extractable DON as the difference between total dissolved N and dissolved inorganic N.</p> 
     <p>We mixed and subsampled remaining air-dried soils for analysis of total C and N. Subsamples were ground on a rotary soil grinder (Planetary Micro Mill Pulverisette 7, Fritsch GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, Germany), and 2 mg of ground soil were analyzed on a Perkin Elmer 2400 Elemental Analyzer (Perkin Elmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) for total C and N. Volumetric water content was estimated after drying a 100 g subsample of field moist soil at 105°C for one day

    <title>Discussion</title> 
    <p>This study tested the hypothesis that extractable dissolved organic N pools would increase along a precipitation and production gradient from west to east across US grasslands. Unlike two previous studies at the same sites 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-McCulley1">
      [14]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Barrett1">
      [15]
     </xref>, we did not find a west to east increase in total soil N; soil C and C:N did increase from west to east as in previous studies. Also like previous studies, we found no increase in inorganic N supply rates from west to east, even though plant uptake does increase (ANPP-N, 
     <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107775-t001">
      Table 1
     </xref>). This supports previous conclusions that N becomes more limiting, and the N cycle grows tighter, from west to east. We did observe, however, that pools of KCl-extractable dissolved inorganic and organic N, representing exchangeable + free soil N 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Nsholm1">
      [27]
     </xref>, increased from west to east.</p> 
    <p>These data must be considered as suggestive, rather than conclusive, given a number of limitations to this small study. Our one-time measurements of KCl-extractable DIN and DON and our one resin probe incubation give an incomplete characterization of the long-term mean pools and rates for these grassland sites. Pool size is not necessarily indicative of cycling rate or ecological importance, as a large pool might result from high production or low demand. We did not characterize the chemical composition or molecular weight distribution of DON, thus we cannot speculate on how much of the DON is potentially plant-available. There are artifacts associated with each of the field methods that could reduce the sensitivity of N pool and production estimates. The soil and root disturbance associated with soil sampling may release DON that would not naturally be available in the soil 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107775-Hobbie1">

Because less nitrate is likely to reach the resin probes when soil moisture is limiting, regardless of actual mineralization rates, we consider resin probes to be better indicators than extractions of the available N that is accessible by plants

    <p>This study provides one piece of support for the broader hypothesis that organic N may serve as a nitrogen source for grassland production—a source that would explain how plant N uptake (ANPP-N) is able to increase along the precipitation gradient without a concomitant increase in N mineralization rates. Our results show that a sizeable pool of KCl-extractable dissolved organic N resides in these grassland soils, and that this N pool increases from west to east across the Great Plains precipitation gradient. The larger KCl-extractable DON pools at the eastern end of the precipitation gradient open the possibility that DON as a source of plant N may help resolve discrepancies in between model predictions and measurements of available N. If so, ecosystem models such as Biome-BGC, Century, PnET, and TEM may be missing a source of N for grasslands. These models represent the N required for primary productivity as “mineral N” generated by N mineralization

    <title>Conclusions</title> 
    <p>We found that the abundance of DON increased across the west-to-east along the precipitation and productivity gradient of US Great Plains grasslands, suggesting that it could be a significant source of N if plants are able to utilize it. If organic N is an important component of available N in US grasslands, it may explain why ecosystem models that do not include plant use of organic N are unable to predict N supply rates across the US grasslands. Additional studies must be conducted to determine if grass species dominating the US Great Plains assimilate biologically-relevant quantities of organic N.</p>
