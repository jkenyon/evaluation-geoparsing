       <title>Background</title> 
       <p>The prevalence of different biotic processes (limiting similarity, weaker competitor exclusion) and historical contingency due to priority effects are in the focus of ongoing discussions about community assembly and non-random functional trait distributions.</p>

       <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title> 
       <p>We experimentally manipulated assembly history in a grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment) by applying two factorially crossed split-plot treatments to all communities: (i) duration of weeding (never weeded since sowing or cessation of weeding after 3 or 6 years); (ii) seed addition (control vs. seed addition 4 years after sowing). Spontaneous colonization of new species in the control treatment without seed addition increased realized species richness and functional richness (FRic), indicating continuously denser packing of niches. Seed addition resulted in forced colonization and increased realized species richness, FRic, functional evenness (FEve) and functional divergence (FDiv), i.e. higher abundances of species with extreme trait values. Furthermore, the colonization of new species led to a decline in FEve through time, suggesting that weaker competitors were reduced in abundance or excluded. Communities with higher initial species richness or with longer time since cessation of weeding were more restricted in the entry of new species and showed smaller increases in FRic after seed addition than other communities. The two assembly-history treatments caused a divergence of species compositions within communities originally established with the same species. Communities originally established with different species converged in species richness and functional trait composition over time, but remained more distinct in species composition.</p> 
      </sec>
      <sec> 
       <title>Conclusions/Significance</title> 
       <p>Contrasting biotic processes (limiting similarity, weaker competitor exclusion) increase functional convergence between communities initially established with different species. Historical contingency with regard to realized species compositions could not be eradicated by cessation of weeding or forced colonization and was still detectable 5 years after application of these treatments, providing evidence for the role of priority effects in community assembly.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title> 
    <p>A deeper insight into the mechanisms which control community assembly is central to understand ecosystem functioning and the maintenance of biodiversity. Functional diversity, i.e. the extent of trait differences among co-occurring species 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Tilman1">
      [1]
     </xref>, has been proposed as an important characteristic of biological assemblages. The intimate link between traits and the functioning of organisms 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Lavorel1">
      [2]
     </xref> suggests that patterns of functional trait distributions within and between communities may provide insights into the operation of non-neutral community assembly rules 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Weiher1">
      [3]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-deBello1">
      [4]
     </xref>. Given a regional species pool with unlimited dispersal, community assembly is often assumed to result from two distinct non-random processes of species sorting: environmental filtering (abiotic filters) and species interactions (biotic filters). Environmental filtering is likely to reduce functional diversity by selecting species with similar ecological characteristics ( = trait convergence) which are able to tolerate the local environment 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Daz1">
      [5]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Grime1">
      [6]
     </xref>. Biotic processes may produce different patterns of trait distribution. Niche differentiation through resource partitioning prevents coexisting species from being too similar (i.e. limiting similarity 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-MacArthur1">
      [7]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Chesson1">
      [8]
     </xref>) and is expected to select for species with different ecological characteristics ( = trait divergence). However, it also has been discussed that competition may increase similarity among species ( = trait convergence), when species with similar traits compete relatively equally, while excluding weaker competitors with different traits (i.e. equalizing fitness processes 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Chesson1">
      [8]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-HilleRisLambers1">
      [9]
     </xref>). This niche-based view of community assembly has been challenged by the “neutral theory” 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Hubbell1">
      [10]
     </xref> assuming that functional differences do not play a role in community assembly and that the fitness of all species in a community is equivalent. Different community histories, i.e. priority effects due to differences in the initial floristic composition, the order of arrival of new species and their initial establishment, may also impact the outcome of community assembly and prevent convergence in species and functional trait composition under uniform environmental conditions 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Drake1">
      [11]
     </xref>–
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Fukami1">
      [13]
     </xref>.</p> 
    <p>In natural ecosystems, the importance of biotic processes causing trait convergence and divergence in community assembly is difficult to disentangle because abiotic processes may also cause trait convergence or counterbalance biotic trait divergence 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Mayfield1">
      [14]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Gtzenberger1">
      [15]
     </xref>. In addition, long-term effects due to priority effects and the role of dispersal limitation are hard to identify in communities with unknown assembly history. Biodiversity experiments, where abiotic effects are controlled for by randomizing plots with different plant diversity under relatively homogeneous environmental conditions are an opportunity to study biotic processes of community assembly 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Allan1">
      [16]
     </xref>. In previous experiments it has been shown that, when experimental communities of different species richness are opened to colonization of new species, realized species richness can converge rapidly to similar levels 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Pfisterer1">
      [17]
     </xref>. Convergence can be reached even faster when dispersal limitation is reduced by seed addition 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Petermann1">
      [18]
     </xref>. However, convergence of species richness may not be paralleled by convergence of functional trait distribution or species composition and thus provides only limited insight into community assembly. Community-wide use of available niche space encompasses the following components: (i) the amount of niche space spanned out by species in a community (functional richness; FRic), (ii) the evenness of abundance distribution of functionally different species (functional evenness; FEve), and (iii) the degree to which the abundance distribution of functionally different species maximizes divergence in functional trait distributions within a community (functional divergence; FDiv)

    <p>In the present study, we used experimental plots of a grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Roscher1">
      [20]
     </xref>) initially established with different species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 species) and functional group number and composition (1 to 4) to study community assembly processes in response to two factorially crossed split-plot treatments 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Roscher2">
      [21]
     </xref>: (i) duration of weeding leading to different colonization periods of communities (cessation of weeding 6 years after sowing &lt; cessation of weeding 3 years after sowing &lt; never weeded since sowing); (ii) seed addition (control vs. seed addition 4 years after establishment of initial species compositions). During a 5-year study period following the seed addition we monitored species richness and composition and different components of functional diversity (FRic, FEve, FDiv 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Villger1">
      [22]
     </xref>). We assume that our experimental approach controls for abiotic processes of community assembly and that seed addition removes dispersal limitation. We test the following hypothesis: (1) functional richness (FRic) increases in parallel to realized species richness during colonization due to limiting similarity; (2) increasing functional richness is succeeded by a decline in functional evenness (FEve) and functional divergence (FDiv) due to weaker competitor exclusion; (3) the removal of dispersal limitation due to seed addition increases the chance for the establishment of more species with traits advantageous in competition and weaker competitor exclusion, thus reducing realized species richness and FRic in the longer term; (4) historical contingency, i.e. priority effects due to initial species diversity and longer colonization periods, decelerate species gain and increase in FRic; (5) contrasting biotic processes during community assembly increase similarity in functional trait composition between communities through time, but historical contingency remains visible in distinct realized species compositions of communities initially established with different species richness and composition.</p>

     <title>Study site and experimental design</title> 
     <p>The study was conducted on plots of the Jena Experiment, a large grassland biodiversity experiment established in 2002 on former agricultural land 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Roscher1">
       [20]
      </xref>. The experimental site is situated in the floodplain of the river Saale north to the city of Jena (Thuringia, Germany, 50°55′ N, 11°35′ E, 130 m a.s.l.), where a Eutric Fluvisol developed from up to 2 m thick fluvial sediments. A gradient in soil texture ranging from sandy loam in the vicinity of the river to silty clay with increasing distance from the river is due to fluvial dynamics. Mean annual air temperature is 9.3 °C and mean annual precipitation is 587 mm in the area around Jena 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Kluge1">
       [23]
      </xref>. The field site was rented by the research consortium of the Jena Experiment from an agricultural collective for the duration of the research grant. No specific permission was required for the described field study. The Jena Experiment field is not subject to protection for nature conservation and the study did not involve endangered or protected species.</p> 
     <p>The species pool of the experiment consisted of 60 Central European plant species common in semi-natural grasslands (Arrhenatherion community 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Ellenberg1">
       [24]
      </xref>). The species were categorized into four functional groups: grasses (16 species), legumes (12 species), tall herbs (20 species), and small herbs (12 species). The Jena Experiment comprises 78 plots of 20×20 m size. The design combines the factors species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16) and functional group number (1, 2, 3, and 4) in a close-to-orthogonal way with the restriction that plant functional group number cannot exceed species number in a given mixture. Each species-richness level had 16 replicates, except for 14 replicates of the 16-species mixtures because pure legume and small herb mixtures with 16 species were not possible 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Roscher1">
       [20]
      </xref>. Mixture compositions were determined by random drawing with replacement. Plots were assigned to four experimental blocks parallel to the river to account for the gradient in soil texture. Each species-richness level was represented in equal numbers across the four blocks. Sowing density amounted to 1000 viable seeds per m<sup>2</sup> where constant total density was achieved by reducing sowing densities per species proportionally to the number of species in the mixture (for details see 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Roscher1">
       [20]
      </xref>).</p> 
     <p>Within each large plot of the biodiversity experiment, three pairs of 2.00×2.25 m subplots were established separated by 0.3 m distance from each other and at 0.5 m distance from the plot margin. One pair of these subplots was never weeded since the establishment of the experiment in 2002, while all species not included in the initially established species combinations were removed in the other subplots twice per year. Three years after sowing, one pair of the regularly weeded subplots was chosen randomly to stop weeding, while weeding was continued in the other subplot-pair. At the same time, one subplot of each weeding treatment was selected at random for seed addition. A mixture with seeds of all 60 species of the experimental pool at equal proportions was assembled for the seed addition treatment. Subplots were sown with a density of 1000 germinable seeds per m<sup>2</sup> in April 2005 (for details see

Six years after establishment of the biodiversity experiment, weeding was also stopped in the subplot-pair with continuous weeding resulting in the following assembly-history treatments (

       [29]
      </xref> using cover abundances per species derived from repeated inventories (see above) were calculated for each year (1) across communities initially established with 1 to 16 species (plots of the biodiversity experiment) for each treatment combination (subplots varying in seed addition × colonization period; S0+, S0−, S3+, S3−, S6+, S6−), and (2) within communities across treatment combinations (between subplots within the large plots). Similarly, Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were derived from community-weighted means of trait values (CWM) (
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0101928-t001">
       Table 1
      </xref>) to test for dissimilarities in functional trait composition. CWMs were derived for each trait as the average of trait values weighted by the proportional abundance of species with the respective trait value 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Garnier1">
       [30]
      </xref>. CWMs were scaled to values between 0 and 1 before calculating Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. Because Bray-Curtis dissimilarity is based on pair-wise comparisons, all possible combinations were computed and averaged to get a mean value for each subplot.</p> 
     <p>Measures of functional trait diversity quantify the distribution of species in a multidimensional space whose axes are defined by functional characteristics. Three components of functional trait diversity were calculated separately: functional richness (FRic), functional evenness (FEve) and functional divergence (FDiv) 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Villger1">
       [22]
      </xref>, which have been identified to be more sensitive to community assembly rules than species richness 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Mouchet1">
       [31]
      </xref>. FRic represents the amount of multidimensional trait space spanned out by a community and is quantified as the smallest convex set ( =  minimum convex hull) enclosing the volume of the 
      <italic>

      </italic>-dimensional trait space occupied by the species in a community 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Cornwell1">
       [32]
      </xref>. FEve describes how regular the functional trait space is filled by species, weighted by their abundances. The calculation was based on the minimum spanning tree and represents the sum of branch length of all points contained in the

      <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0101928-t001">
       Table 1
      </xref>). Prior to analyses seed mass was log-transformed to reduce the influence of species with large trait values. A Gower dissimilarity matrix 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Gower1">
       [34]

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Lalibert1">
       [35]
      </xref>. To evaluate whether species richness and functional trait diversity converged through time, the coefficient of variation (CV) of these variables was computed across communities and within communities across treatment combinations for each year.</p> 
     <p>Linear mixed-effects models were applied to test for effects of the experimental factors on the response variables measured in the 5-year study period in the split-split-plot colonization experiment. Block and plot identity, subplot pair (S0, S3, S6) and subplot were treated as random factors in a nested sequence. Although the factors species richness and number of functional groups are nearly orthogonal in the Jena Experiment, the design of the experiment is not completely balanced because it is not possible to vary species richness and functional group number completely independently. Starting from a constant null model the fitting sequence of fixed terms followed the a-priori hypotheses of the biodiversity experiment starting with the number of initially established species (log-linear term), the number of functional groups (linear term), factors for the split-plot variables colonization period (with three factor levels) and seed addition (with two factor levels) and their interactions with the main experimental factors. Finally, a term for the different study years (as linear term to focus on directed temporal changes) and its interaction with the previously mentioned experimental factors was entered. The maximum likelihood method was used and likelihood ratio tests were applied to assess the statistical significance of model improvement. The statistical software R (Version 2.11.2,

     <p>A total of 176 species in addition to the 60 experimental species were observed during the study period. An increased number of initially established species and functional groups allowed fewer species to colonize and thus resulted in lower realized species richness after colonization (

    <title>Discussion</title> 
    <p>In spite of sustained efforts to understand patterns of community assembly, the importance of different biotic processes is poorly disentangled so far. We used the opportunity to study biotic processes of community assembly under relatively homogeneous environmental conditions in split-plots of a large grassland biodiversity experiment opened for colonization by new species and removed dispersal limitation through a seed addition treatment

     <title>Species richness and functional trait diversity</title> 
     <p>Species gain and increase in functional richness (FRic) after the opening of experimental communities for colonization by new species was reduced by a higher number of initially established species and a longer colonization period (shorter duration of weeding). The negative effects of a higher initially sown plant diversity on the spontaneous colonization of new species may be attributable to the lower stability of low-diverse communities even in the absence of weeding 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Roscher3">
       [40]
      </xref>, while disturbance through weeding and the removal of competitors in communities with a shorter colonization period may have accelerated the colonization success of new species. The long-term effects of higher initial plant diversity in reducing the number of colonizer species are in line with previous short-term studies in the Jena Experiment and other biodiversity experiments (e.g. 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-vanderPutten1">
       [41]
      </xref>–
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Roscher4">
       [43]
      </xref>). In our experiment, communities established with a lower number of species even exceeded realized species richness of communities established with a higher number of species after communities were opened for colonization (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101928-g002">
       Fig. 2A
      </xref>). Seed addition led to a higher species gain and FRic increase than without seed addition, and the efficiency of seed addition was increased, when weeding was continued for a longer period. Higher levels of realized species richness after seed addition are commonly found because plant communities are often under-saturated with species due to a limited species pool or dispersal constraints 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Clark1">
       [44]
      </xref>, 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Myers1">
       [45]
      </xref>. Although none of the species added as seed failed to establish completely after seed addition 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Roscher2">
       [21]
      </xref> and single communities accumulated indeed up to 60 species one or two years after seed addition, average species richness in the seed addition treatments declined again and did not exceed 35 species in the last year of the study (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101928-g002">
       Fig. 2A
      </xref>). This upper limit of realized species richness is close to the realized species number in plots initially established with all 60 experimental species in the Jena Experiment (unpubl. data) and indicates that the seed addition led to forced colonization with a short-term over-saturation with species followed by species loss.</p> 
     <p>Functional richness (FRic), which quantifies the volume of functional space filled by a community, increased in parallel to species gain in sub-plots without seed addition, but the increment of FRic was flattened in subplots with a higher number of initially sown species (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101928-g003">
       Fig. 3B
      </xref>). The concurrent increase in species richness and FRic indicated that newly colonizing species were functionally different from residents, which is in line with the view that complementary resource requirements of resident and colonizer species select for a maximization of functional richness (indicating limiting similarity). In contrast, FRic reached maximum values in the year after the seed addition in sub-plots with seed addition (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101928-g003">
       Fig. 3C
      </xref>), followed by maximum values of functional divergence (FDiv) in the third year (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101928-g003">
       Fig. 3I
      </xref>) before both measures of functional trait diversity declined more strongly than realized species richness in subsequent years. Functional evenness was also higher after seed addition, but decreased continuously through time (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101928-g003">

       [19]
      </xref>. Our analysis of functional trait diversity was based on multiple traits. Although different functional traits may be associated with different processes during community assembly and relate to different niche axes

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Mason2">
       [47]
      </xref>, plants have to balance different functions which is often reflected in fundamental functional trade-offs. Probably, the short-term increase in FDiv and maximum levels of FRic after seed addition were due to the advantage of species with traits associated with rapid establishment followed by weaker competitor exclusion. Weaker competitor exclusion (related to equalizing fitness processes) in grasslands at high productivity levels is discussed as a biotic process resulting in niche reduction in favour of perennial species with higher ability for resource competition

     <title>Convergence in species and functional trait composition</title> 
     <p>Previous studies have reported that experimental communities initially sown with different plant diversity and opened to colonization converged in species richness and functional or phylogenetic composition while keeping different species composition 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Fukami1">
       [13]
      </xref>, 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Cadotte1">
       [50]
      </xref>. Our results based on a 5-year study period starting 4 years after establishing communities with different plant diversity also showed stronger between-community convergence in functional trait composition than in species composition. In subplots with a different assembly history, however, we found a divergence in communities initially established with higher plant diversity (4 and more species, 
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101928-g005">
       Fig. 5B
      </xref>), while communities initially established as monocultures or 2-species mixtures maintained their initial convergent state. Probably, this divergence at higher species-richness levels was due to the stochasticity in colonization processes and the persistence of priority effects, which may cause high variability in community structure among similar sites 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Chase2">
       [51]
      </xref>.</p> 
     <p>It becomes increasingly apparent that multiple processes are involved in community assembly. A number of recent studies have shown that patterns of functional trait composition depend on environmental conditions and the traits considered 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Spasojevic1">
       [46]
      </xref>, 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-BernardVerdier1">
       [48]
      </xref>, 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Gerhold1">
       [49]
      </xref>, 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0101928-Price1">
       [52]
      </xref>. Our study based on multiple traits provided evidence that contrasting biotic processes govern shifts of functional community composition in experimental grasslands with relatively homogeneous environmental conditions. Limiting similarity played a larger role during early phases of colonization. Colonization of new species went in parallel with an increase in FRic indicating that the newly colonizing species were functionally different from residents (hypothesis 1). Increasing FRic was succeeded by a decline in FEve suggesting weaker competitor exclusion in the longer run (hypothesis 2). These processes were accelerated when seed limitation was removed through seed addition resulting in peak values of FRic and larger values of FEve, which declined again in subsequent years (hypothesis 3). Nevertheless, FRic and FEve remained at higher levels in subplots with seed addition compared to those without seed addition during the 5-year study period, indicating that the removal of seed limitation improved the chance for assembling communities with a higher number of species with traits advantageous in competition. However, in addition to the series of assembly processes related to limiting similarity and weaker competitor exclusion, our study has clearly shown that historical contingency in assembly processes due to priority effects may be traceable over longer time (hypothesis 4). First, species gain and increase in FRic were considerably reduced when plant communities were initially established with greater diversity such that, realized species richness and FRic of initially low-diverse communities were even greater than in initially high-diverse communities after opening for colonization. Second, a longer duration of the colonization period decreased the accelerated species gain and the increase in FRic in initially low-diverse communities and maintained FEve at lower levels. In addition, the prominent role of priority effects becomes visible by the lagged convergence of species composition relative to functional trait composition of communities initially established with different species compositions (hypothesis 5).</p>
