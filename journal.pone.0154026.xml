     <abstract> 
      <p>The relationship between species richness (SR) and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) is still a central and debated issue in community ecology. Previous studies have often emphasized the relationship of alpha diversity (number of species identity) to the mean ANPP with respect to the SR-ANPP relationship while neglecting the contribution of beta diversity (dissimilarity in species composition) to the mean ANPP and to the stability of ANPP (coefficient of ANPP: CV of ANPP). In this study, we used alpha and beta diversity, mean ANPP and the CV of ANPP collected from 159 sites and belonging to three vegetation types in the Xinjiang temperate grassland to first examine their trends along climatic factors and among different vegetation types and then test the relationship among alpha (beta) diversity and mean ANPP and the CV of ANPP. Our results showed that in the Xinjiang temperate grasslands, alpha diversity was positively and linearly correlated with MAP but unimodally correlated with MAT. Meanwhile, beta diversity was unimodally correlated with MAP but linearly correlated with MAT. Relative to desert steppe, meadow steppe and typical steppe had the highest alpha and beta diversity, respectively. Except for ANPP exhibiting a quadratic relationship with MAP, no significant relationship was found among ANPP, the CV of ANPP and climatic factors. ANPP and the CV of ANPP also exhibited no apparent patterns in variation among different vegetation types. Our results further showed that mean ANPP was closely associated with alpha diversity. Both linear and unimodal relationships were detected between alpha diversity and mean ANPP, but their particular form was texture-dependent. Meanwhile, the CV of ANPP was positively correlated with beta diversity. Our results indicated that in addition to incorporating alpha diversity and mean ANPP, incorporating beta diversity and the CV of ANPP could expand our understanding of the SR-ANPP relationship.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title> 
    <p>The relationship between species richness (SR) and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) has been a central issue in community ecology [

      1
     </xref>–
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref003">
      3
     </xref>]. Despite the patterns and mechanisms of the SR-ANPP relationship having been widely discussed in most terrestrial ecosystems [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref004">
      4
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref005">
      5
     </xref>], the reported SR-ANPP relationship remains controversial, ranging from a unimodal to positively linear relationship to a neutral form in different ecosystems [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref003">
      3
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref006">

     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref007">
      7
     </xref>]. These varied SR-ANPP relationships have often been explained by differently varying patterns in alpha diversity (numbers of species identity in community) along the ANPP gradient [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref005">
      5
     </xref>], whereas the contribution of beta diversity (dissimilarity in species composition in the community) to the SR-ANPP relationship has been neglected. Some recent studies have suggested that in addition to alpha diversity, beta diversity also plays an important factor in regulating the SR-ANPP relationship because species richness is heterogeneously distributed in ecosystems [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref008">
      8
     </xref>], providing a new mechanism for understanding the SR-ANPP relationship. However, our knowledge about the contribution of alpha and beta diversity to ANPP is still limited, and more studies are needed.</p> 
    <p>In particular, the mechanisms of alpha and beta diversity in influencing the SR-ANPP relationship are different. For alpha diversity, if the peak diversity occurs at the intermediate level of ANPP, then a unimodal SR-ANPP relationship will be observed [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref005">
      5
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref009">
      9
     </xref>]. If the peak diversity appears at the highest level of ANPP, then a positively linear relationship is produced [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref006">
      6
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref010">
      10
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref011">
      11
     </xref>]. For beta diversity, a high dissimilarity in species composition often appears at a high level of ANPP [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref012">
      12
     </xref>], which in turn generates a positive and linear relationship between beta diversity and ANPP [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref013">
      13
     </xref>]. These findings suggest that for a given ecosystem, the observed SR-ANPP relationship is simultaneously determined by alpha and beta diversity. For example, alpha and beta diversity alone or together can result in a positive and linear SR-ANPP relationship (if one exists). Thus, separately exploring the relationship among alpha diversity, beta diversity and ANPP could expand our understanding of the mechanisms influencing the SR-ANPP relationship.</p> 
    <p>Generally, ecologists have often used mean ANPP to test its relationship with species richness [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref002">
      2
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref003">
      3
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref006">
      6
     </xref>] while ignoring the connection between species richness and the coefficient of variation (CV) of ANPP. The CV of ANPP is another important dimension for understanding the SR-ANPP relationship because ANPP also shifts with the change in species composition and environmental conditions [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref002">
      2
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref006">
      6
     </xref>]. In particular, the CV of ANPP reflects the degree of stability in ANPP [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref014">
      14
     </xref>–
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref016">
      16
     </xref>]. A greater (smaller) CV of ANPP indicates that the community has a lower (higher) stability in ANPP [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref014">
      14
     </xref>–
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref016">
      16
     </xref>]. Despite the importance of the CV of ANPP in understanding ecosystem stability, studies on the connection of the CV of ANPP to alpha and beta diversity are still lacking, which in turn limits our understanding of the SR-ANPP relationship.</p> 
    <p>At a regional scale, the SR-ANPP relationship is also influenced by environmental factors and vegetation types because alpha and beta diversity, the mean ANPP and the CV of ANPP are significantly regulated by environmental factors and vegetation types [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref006">
      6
     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref010">

     </xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref017">
      17
     </xref>]. A recent study reported that the positive SR-ANPP relationship observed in the temperate grasslands of China stemmed from the parallel responding patterns of SR (alpha diversity) and ANPP along a climatic gradient [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref010">
      10
     </xref>]. These studies imply that to better understand the SR-ANPP relationship, the variations in alpha and beta diversity, mean ANPP and CV of ANPP and the relationships among these variables should be separately tested in each vegetation type.</p> 
    <p>Here, we used alpha and beta diversity, mean ANPP and the CV of ANPP measured in the Xinjiang temperate grasslands in northwest China, which cover a wide range of climatic gradients and include different vegetation types, to address the following three questions: (1) how does alpha and beta diversity, mean ANPP and the CV of ANPP in the Xinjiang temperate grassland vary along a climatic gradient and among different vegetation types? (2) What is the general relationship between alpha diversity and ANPP and the CV of ANPP in the Xinjiang temperate grasslands? (3) What is the general relationship between beta diversity and ANPP and the CV of ANPP in the Xinjiang temperate grasslands?</p>

     <title>Survey of alpha, beta diversity, mean values and CV of ANPP</title> 
     <p>We investigated alpha and beta diversity, mean ANPP and the CV of ANPP in the Xinjiang temperate grasslands in 2011, 2012 and 2013. A survey was conducted in the summers (July-August) of each year because ANPP reaches its peak value during this period [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref019">
       19
      </xref>]. In this study, only temperate meadow steppe (MS), temperate steppe (TS) and temperate desert steppe (DS) data were used for further analysis because their sample sizes satisfied statistical requirements and were proportional to their distribution area (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154026.g001">
       Fig 1
      </xref>). Thus, a total of 159 field sites, which were evenly distributed in the Xinjiang temperate grasslands, were included in this study (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154026.g001">
       Fig 1
      </xref>).</p> 
     <p>At each site, a 100×100 m sampling area was randomly selected. After recording the geographical coordinates, elevation and vegetation types, three or five 1×1 m quadrats were randomly chosen within this sampling area in each site. For each quadrat, we first recorded species names and the individual numbers for each species, and then we harvested the ANPP for each quadrat. We pre-dried the harvested ANPP in the field and then dried it to constant weight at 70°C in an oven in the laboratory of Xinjiang Agriculture University [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref010">
       10
      </xref>]. Based on these investigated data, we calculated the alpha and beta diversity, mean ANPP and CV of ANPP for each site. In particular, alpha diversity was expressed by the mean number of species appearing in all quadrats of each site. The beta diversity for each site was calculated as the proportion of unshared species among these investigated quadrats (one minus the Jaccard index). Specifically, beta diversity was calculated via following two steps. Firstly, for any two given quadrats (i.e. quadrats 
      <italic>
       i
      </italic> and 
      <italic>
       j
      </italic>, respectively), we calculated the proportion of unshared species between them using the equation: 1-a/(a+b+c), where a is the number of shared species between two quadrats, b is the number of species that appeared in quadrats

       i
      </italic> but not in 
      <italic>

      </xref>]. This procedure was repeated to calculate the beta diversity between any two combined quadrats (3 or 10 combinations if a site had three or five quadrats, respectively). Then, for each site, the mean values of beta diversity was calculated and further used to explore their relationship with ANPP (above-ground net primary productivity)[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154026.ref013">
       13

     <title>Collection of climatic variables</title> 
     <p>Based on the long-term meteorological data (1961–2010) obtained from 756 evenly distributed climatic stations in China, we calculated the mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT) of each site in our study. In detail, MAP and MAT were calculated from a Geographic Information System-based multiple regression method which used latitude, longitude and elevation as predicators [

          <p>Our results showed that in the Xinjiang temperate grasslands, despite the influence on alpha and beta diversity by both MAP and MAT, alpha and beta diversity responded differently to MAP and MAT. We found that alpha diversity responded linearly to MAP but unimodally to MAT, which is consistent with previous studies conducted in Xinjiang and on a global scale [

            26
           </xref>]. These results were also in agreement with the prediction of the water-energy dynamics hypothesis, which suggests that in arid regions, species richness is positively correlated with water availability but negatively associated with energy availability [

            27
           </xref>]. Beside the effect of water and energy dynamics, the relationship between alpha diversity and MAP, MAT on our study was also influenced by the snow and snow melt water. Particularly, Xinjiang has a high snow depth (16.7–18.7 cm) and longer snow cover time (87.3–85.4 days a<sup>-1</sup>) relative to the other provinces in China [

            29
           </xref>]. Moreover, the thawing period of snow in our study area was coincided with the period of species germination, indicating that snow melt water also had potential effects on species diversity distribution. Actually, snow melt water could influence species diversity via following two mechanisms: Firstly, snow melt water could indirectly decrease the air temperature during the processes of thaw, which may affect species germination time especially in the meadow steppe where was originally limited by temperature. Secondly, snow melt water will improve soil water availability, which can facilitate species diversity and plant growth in this arid regions[

          <p>The quadratic relationship between ANPP and MAP in our study was inconsistent with previous studies in the temperate grasslands in Inner Mongolia and in Kansas, which had reported a positive and linear correlation between ANPP and MAP. [

The low alpha diversity in our study could be explained by the relatively low aridity index (ratio of precipitation to evapotranspiration) in the Xinjiang temperate grasslands (0.01–0.10) because previous studies have confirmed that the plant species richness in arid and semi-arid regions in Northwest China is tightly determined by the aridity index [

          <p>The higher beta diversity in meadow and typical steppes observed in this study indicated that in the Xinjiang temperate grasslands, the species community is highly dissimilar in meadow and typical steppes, which is consistent with a previous study on Inner Mongolian grasslands, which reported that the highest species dissimilarity was observed under high MAP conditions (meadow steppe) [

In particular, a positive and linear relationship was detected in meadow and desert steppes, but a unimodal relationship was found in typical steppe. This finding was inconsistent with a recent study that reported the unimodal relationship as a worldwide phenomenon in grasslands with respect to the relationship of species richness to ANPP [

     <p>By examining variations in alpha and beta diversity, mean ANPP and the CV of APPP along climatic factors and among different vegetation types, our study showed that in the Xinjiang temperate grasslands, alpha and beta diversity were closely associated with both MAP and MAT and were highest in meadow and typical steppes relative to desert steppe. Except for ANPP exhibiting a quadratic relationship with MAP, no significant relationship was found between ANPP, the CV of ANPP and climatic factors. ANPP and the CV of ANPP also exhibited no apparent patterns in variation among different vegetation types. Based on testing the relationship between species diversity and ANPP, our results further showed that alpha diversity was tightly correlated with mean ANPP, whereas beta diversity was significantly associated with the CV of ANPP. Our results demonstrated that a positive linear and unimodal relationship appeared simultaneously in different vegetation types in the Xinjiang temperate grasslands.</p>
