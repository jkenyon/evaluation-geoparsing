     <abstract> 
      <p>Macroalgal assemblages are some of the most productive systems on earth and they contribute significantly to nearshore ecosystems. Globally, macroalgal assemblages are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities such as sedimentation, eutrophication and climate change. Despite this, very little research has considered the potential effects of canopy loss on primary productivity, although the literature is rich with evidence showing the ecological effects of canopy disturbance. In this study we used experimental removal plots of habitat-dominating algae (Order Fucales) that had been initiated several years previously to construct a chronosequence of disturbed macroalgal communities and to test if there were legacy effects of canopy loss on primary productivity. We used 
       <italic>
        in situ
       </italic> photo-respirometry to test the primary productivity of algal assemblages in control and removal plots at two intertidal elevations. In the mid tidal zone assemblage, the removal plots at two sites had average primary productivity values of only 40% and 60% that of control areas after 90 months. Differences in productivity were associated with lower biomass and density of the fucoid algal canopy and lower taxa richness in the removal plots after 90 months. Low-shore plots, established three years earlier, showed that the loss of the large, dominant fucoid resulted in at least 50% less primary productivity of the algal assemblage than controls, which lasted for 90 months; other smaller fucoid species had recruited but they were far less productive. The long term reduction in primary productivity following a single episode of canopy loss of a dominant species in two tidal zones suggests that these assemblages are not very resilient to large perturbations. Decreased production output may have severe and long-lasting consequences on the surrounding communities and has the potential to alter nutrient cycling in the wider nearshore environment.</p>

      [15]

    <p>Although the long-term consequences of losing habitat-forming species, particularly fucoid algae, on community structure and composition are increasingly understood

     </xref>–
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Ingolfsson1">
      [22]
     </xref>, there is relatively little information on the potential consequences to a critical ecosystem function, that of primary productivity. Macroalgal diversity has been shown to enhance primary productivity 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Bruno2">
      [23]
     </xref> and nitrogen uptake 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Bracken1">
      [24]
     </xref>, at least in some circumstances, and the loss of these species could have significant impacts on the stability of nearshore ecosystems. Furthermore, there may be very little functional replacement of canopy forming macroalgae within intertidal assemblages 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Schiel1">
      [4]
     </xref>, potentially making these assemblages vulnerable to prolonged shifts in community composition.</p> 
    <p>Chronosequences have been extensively used by ecologists to examine successional patterns where the long life span of species precludes time series observations of the entire successional sequence 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Wardle1">
      [25]
     </xref>. A chronosequence can be referred to as a mosaic of patches that have been developing for various lengths of time following a known disturbance. Such observations have been useful in formulating models of succession in terrestrial plant communities 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Wardle1">
      [25]
     </xref> and seagrass beds 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Peterson1">
      [26]
     </xref>. After a major disturbance, in certain cases, the community may not reach what is considered its ‘climax state,’ even after an extended period of time 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Lilley1">
      [16]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Underwood1">
      [18]
     </xref>. Long-term shifts in community composition have the potential to drastically alter the functioning of macroalgal assemblages. While chronosequences have been used to elucidate patterns of succession, they may also be useful in examining changes in primary productivity over time.</p> 
    <p>Here we use a series of patches, disturbed experimentally at known times, and field-based photo-respirometry to test the legacy effects of the loss of canopy-forming algae on primary productivity.

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Tait1">
      [27]
     </xref>, thereby allowing them to recover along their natural successional trajectory. Understanding the direct and indirect effects of canopy loss on primary productivity over ecologically significant time-scales will allow insight into the role of macroalgal succession in the variability of primary productivity. The aim of our work, therefore, was to test the ability of macroalgal assemblages to recover to control (or pre-disturbed) levels of primary productivity and to determine the association of primary productivity with community composition. We test the null hypothesis that primary productivity of mid and low shore assemblages is unaffected by canopy removal and time since removal.</p>

     <p>To test the long-term consequences of disturbance to dominant canopies on primary productivity, a combination of old and new removal plots were used. Canopy-forming algal species of the Order Fucales were removed from areas at two tidal heights (low and mid shore). In mid-shore algal assemblages (tidal elevation of 0.8–0.9 m), the dominant fucoid 
      <italic>
       Hormosira banksii

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Schiel1">
       [4]
      </xref>. In the low shore zone (tidal elevation of 0–0.25 m), the large fucoid 
      <italic>
       Durvillaea antarctica
      </italic> was removed from 2 m×2 m plots (n = 4) at North Reef, Moeraki and Oaro Reef, Kaikoura (42°30′S, 173°30′E) in March 2006 to examine the role of 
      <italic>
       D. antarctica
      </italic> in driving community composition. 
      <italic>
       D. antarctica
      </italic> adults can reach 10 m in length, densities of several plants per m<sup>2</sup>, and a biomass of 70 kg per m<sup>2</sup>. Because the very uneven limestone and conglomerate reef at Oaro Reef rendered it impossible to attach the incubation chambers effectively (see below), this site could not be used for photo-respirometry. In both mid and low intertidal assemblages, therefore, we used these plots to gauge the long-term consequences of canopy loss to primary productivity.</p> 
     <p>To gauge shorter term effects, we then added new canopy removal treatments in the mid-shore during March 2008 (Moeraki) and January 2010 (Kaikoura) and in the low-shore (Moeraki) in September 2009. New controls with 
      <italic>
       H. banksii
      </italic> (mid-shore) and 
      <italic>
       D. antarctica
      </italic> (low shore) canopies intact (n = 3), were also established, to produce a balanced design along with the old controls, which remained with 
      <italic>
       H. banksii

       [16]
      </xref>. This chronosequence of canopy disturbance enabled us to test the trajectory of recovery of primary productivity following single episodes of major disturbance.</p> 
     <p>Incubations measuring primary productivity were done using custom-designed photo-respirometry chambers 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Tait1">
       [27]
      </xref>. These were sealed around target assemblages immediately prior to incubations and removed after incubations to limit any long-term disturbance to the target assemblage. This allowed assemblages to be exposed to natural conditions and sampled over time with minimal impact 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Tait1">
       [27]

Before attachment of chambers, a two-compound epoxy resin was used to fill in deeper cracks within the substratum so that chambers could be sealed, but care was taken not to change the reef composition such that pooling of water occurred. Before incubations were done, all visible invertebrates were removed from the assemblages to limit the effects of heterotrophic respiration. On the flat reef surfaces, the only manipulation of the reef was the drilling of holes for rawl plugs for attachment of chambers. Oxygen concentrations were sampled using a Hach LDO meter at intervals no greater than 20 minutes to avoid super-saturation of oxygen 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Tait1">
       [27]
      </xref>. The change in dissolved oxygen over time was then converted to changes in carbon uptake using a P∶Q (photosynthetic quotient) ratio of 1∶1 and scaled up to carbon uptake per m<sup>2</sup> of reef surface (g C m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>). During incubations, irradiance was measured using HOBO irradiance and temperature loggers (cross-calibrated with Li-Cor LI 192 quantum sensor) and averaged for the period of the incubation. Plots were sampled across a range of natural irradiance intensities (from 0–2100 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), with single plots often taking multiple days to sample. Primary productivity for each treatment was then taken as the maximum productivity (P<sub>max</sub>) per sample area and adjusted to g C m<sup>2</sup> hr<sup>−1</sup>; it was also standardized as productivity per dry biomass of algal material mg C gDW<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> to take account of the changing biomass per area in the experimental plots. Because treatment and control plots were re-visited throughout the years of the experiment, harvesting plots for biomass was not plausible, but dry biomass was estimated using length/mass relationships of

     <p>In addition to assessing primary productivity, the cover and diversity of species were measured at each sampling time. This was done so that primary productivity could be related to recovery and succession through time as the species composition changed. During primary productivity sampling, all macroalgal species within the areas covered by the chambers were recorded and their percentage cover estimated using a gridded quadrat. Multi-dimensional scaling plots (MDS) using PRIMER were used to visualize the variation and recovery trajectory in community structure between treatments through time. Differences between treatment plots through time were analyzed using PERMANOVA (using 9999 simulation permutations;

The differences between treatments and sites persisted throughout the first year at Moeraki and at least for 6 months at Kaikoura (per-area Treatment×Site interaction at 6 months: F
      <italic>

    <p>The loss or severe reduction of canopy-forming algae in the nearshore zone has produced changes in communities worldwide, usually as a result of multiple stressors 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Schiel6">
      [31]
     </xref>. Where fucoid algae are involved, the trajectory of recovery is often slow, sometimes over decades

     </xref>. The consequences of these changes on one of the most important ecosystem functions, that of primary productivity, are generally not known. Here, however, we show that reduced productivity occurs for several years in both the mid and low intertidal assemblages, primarily because of the slow pace of recovery of canopy species 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Schiel5">
      [29]
     </xref> and the advent of lower-lying turfs and fleshy algae.</p> 
    <p>Community changes following fucoid canopy impacts are complex and varied among different regions. On British shores, for example, loss of a dominant may allow other fucoids to establish, involve grazer dynamics and eventual slow re-establishment of the original dominant species

      [32]

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Underwood2">
      [33]
     </xref> showed that a severe storm removed large patches of this species and that its recovery over several years was affected by both direct and indirect effects of grazers. Bellgrove et al 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Bellgrove1">
      [34]
     </xref> speculated for shores further south in Australia that patches of

     </xref>, however, showed that over 17 years, 
     <italic>
      Hormosira
     </italic> canopies came and went in response to storms and wave damage, and that canopy losses in the mid intertidal zone triggered a series of cascading losses of assemblage structure, as newly exposed understory species became desiccated and died off. These were often replaced for several years by coralline turfs and seasonally blooming ephemeral species before eventual recovery of the 
     <italic>
      Hormosira
     </italic> canopy. It was experimentally shown, however, that even after 8 years, there were still differences in biomass and diversity between canopy-impacted areas and controls

      [29]
     </xref>. Our study shows the resulting compromised primary productivity over several years.</p> 
    <p>In both the mid and low intertidal zones, the removal of the dominant fucoid canopy immediately resulted in a large fall in primary productivity. This is hardly surprising as both the dominant biomass and much of the areal cover of algae were lost. Biomass has often been used as a surrogate for rates of primary productivity in macroalgae 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Reed1">
      [30]
     </xref>. Our study showed that biomass was a key determinant of overall per-area primary productivity, but when productivity was expressed per-biomass there was still significantly lower productivity in removal treatments, indicating that biomass alone does not entirely explain the loss of productivity and that certain taxa are disproportionately important. In particular, the dynamics of light use by the species that dominated canopy removal areas play a key role in this response. For example, on both a per-area and per-biomass basis, corallines are some of the least productive algae. Their calcium carbonate structure makes them heavy relative to their photosynthetic capability 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Littler1">
      [35]
     </xref>. In contrast to corallines, the ephemeral species that bloomed in removal areas had high productivity on a per-biomass basis, but were patchy and did not have great productivity on a per-area basis. Species such as sea lettuce (
     <italic>
      Ulva
     </italic> spp), for example, in a full light environment can have productivity as high as 10 mg C gDW<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Littler1">
      [35]
     </xref>, compared to corallines at 0.3 mg C gDW<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Tait1">
      [27]
     </xref>. Similar high levels of per-biomass productivity occur for other ephemeral algae 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Littler1">
      [35]
     </xref>. In intact assemblages with a full fucoid canopy, these species remain in the understory, along with several species of low-shore fucoids, and contribute to the overall assemblage primary productivity at high light intensities 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Tait2">
      [36]
     </xref>. However, when fully exposed to a high light environment following canopy removal, they can undergo photo-inhibition 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Tait3">
      [37]
     </xref>, and often desiccate and bleach. In contrast to the loss of smaller fucoids higher up on the shore, the loss of the much larger “bull kelp” 
     <italic>
      Durvillaea antarctica
     </italic> on the low shore removes the abrasion of the substratum by fronds 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Santelices1">
      [38]
     </xref>, and results in elongation of corallines and the recruitment of lower biomass species with far less areal productivity. Even an incursion by the invasive annual kelp 
     <italic>
      Undaria
     </italic> did not compensate in primary productivity for the loss of 
     <italic>
      Durvillaea
     </italic>.</p> 
    <p>If the results seen in our study apply to assemblages elsewhere, where the loss of dominant algal canopies has led to long-term changes in communities, then there are potentially large consequences to benthic primary productivity for algal communities worldwide. Given the susceptibility of large, canopy-forming macroalgae to disturbance 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Irving1">
      [8]
     </xref>–
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Wernberg1">
      [14]
     </xref>, understanding how their loss affects important ecosystem functions such as primary productivity is essential. Major alterations to carbon fixation through primary productivity have the potential to alter the functioning of ecosystems and the functioning of global biogeochemical cycles 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Falkowski1">
      [39]
     </xref>. Decreased carbon output could have far-reaching consequences, with stable isotope signatures indicating the importance of macroalgae well beyond the nearshore environment

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026986-Airoldi1">
      [5]
