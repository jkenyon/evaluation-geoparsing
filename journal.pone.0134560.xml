      <p>Fertilization via nutrient deposition and agricultural inputs is one of the most important factors driving decreases in plant diversity. However, we still do not fully understand which processes (niche process or neutral process) are more important in leading to decreases in plant diversity caused by fertilization. A hypothesis-based approach was used to test the relative importance of niche versus neutral processes along a fertilization gradient in an alpine meadow community on the eastern Tibetan plateau, China. Niche overlap values were calculated for species biomass, and the null model was used to generate the values of niche overlap expected at random. A linear regression modeling was used to evaluate the relationship between functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, and leaf total nitrogen concentration) and species relative abundance. Our results demonstrated that observed niche overlap for species biomass was significantly higher than expected at lower fertilization gradients. Moreover, we also found a significantly negative correlation between species relative abundance and specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content, but a significantly positive correlation between relative abundance and leaf nitrogen concentration at lower fertilization gradients. However, these relationships were not significant at higher fertilization gradients. We concluded that community assembly is dynamic progression along the environmental gradients, and niche and neutral processes may together determine species diversity loss in response to fertilization.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title> 
    <p>A large number of experiments have shown that fertilization leads to a decrease in species diversity and a shift in community composition [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref001" ref-type="bibr">
      1
     </xref>, 
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref002" ref-type="bibr">
      2
     </xref>]. Although these negative effects of fertilization on species diversity are well documented by using experimental assemblages [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref003" ref-type="bibr">
      3
     </xref>], the processes responsible for these changes in natural communities are not well understood [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref004" ref-type="bibr">
      4
     </xref>]. Community assembly is regarded as a dynamic progression that is driven by processes such as dispersal, the responses of species to environment, and the biotic interactions (i.e., competition and predation) [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref005" ref-type="bibr">
      5
     </xref>]. More recently, ecologists are now revisiting these processes in order to understand and predict the effects of environmental changes, such as fertilization, on communities. Therefore, a key aim of this work is to evaluate the relative importance of different processes on biological communities.</p> 
    <p>Two distinct views which have been often proposed to explain community structuring are niche assembly and dispersal assembly [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref006" ref-type="bibr">
      6
     </xref>]. In general, niche processes associated with competition and environmental filtering [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref007" ref-type="bibr">
      7
     </xref>] and neutral processes associated with random demographic dynamics [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref006" ref-type="bibr">
      6
     </xref>] determine community composition and structure. In addition, multiple processes can act simultaneously [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref007" ref-type="bibr">
      7
     </xref>]. For example, two opposing niche-based processes (environmental filtering and competitive exclusion) can drive community assembly. Environmental filtering proposes that species occurring together in communities and thus experiencing the same environmental conditions are likely to share similar functional traits [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref008" ref-type="bibr">
      8
     </xref>]. Competitive exclusion proposes that competition is likely to limit the similarity of species functional traits in these environments [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref009" ref-type="bibr">
      9
     </xref>]. Neutral processes predicate that all species are identical in their demographic rates (birth, death, dispersal and speciation rates) and exclusion processes are completely random [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref006" ref-type="bibr">
      6
     </xref>]. Predictions from neutral theory are contrary to the assumptions of niche theory, which asserts that species-specific traits and trade-offs determine the coexistence of species and maintenance of diversity within a community [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref010" ref-type="bibr">
      10
     </xref>, 
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref011" ref-type="bibr">
      11
     </xref>]. However, it is difficult for niche theory to explain very high species diversity, such as in tropical rain forests [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref012" ref-type="bibr">
      12
     </xref>]. Actually, niche theory and neutral theory alone cannot explain many patterns observed in nature. Researchers have attempted to incorporate both of them into more general models [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref013" ref-type="bibr">
      13
     </xref>–
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref017" ref-type="bibr">
      17
     </xref>]. Gravel et al. [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref016" ref-type="bibr">
      16
     </xref>] assumes that communities are located in a continuum (niche and neutrality form ends of a continuum from niche-structured communities to neutral structure). According to their predictions, diversity and abundance patterns along environmental gradients will be the consequence of the balance between stochastic processes and competitive exclusion.</p> 
    <p>The Tibetan Plateau is the youngest and highest plateau in the world. Alpine meadows comprise the representative vegetation on the plateau, and they are also very fragile and sensitive ecosystems due to changes in global climate and land use [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref018" ref-type="bibr">
      18
     </xref>]. Previously, a series of fertilization experiments were conducted in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau to better understand the potential mechanism of species loss due to fertilization [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref019" ref-type="bibr">
      19
     </xref>–
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref021" ref-type="bibr">
      21
     </xref>]. To our knowledge, no previous study has empirically evaluated the relative importance of niche and neutral processes as determinants of community structure and diversity along a fertilization gradient. Furthermore, a definitive answer to what extent communities are structured by niche or neutral processes can be obtained by combining theoretical models with manipulative experiments [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref022" ref-type="bibr">
      22
     </xref>]. Here, we test two hypotheses that derive from neutral and niche theories to evaluate the relative importance of these two different processes along a fertilization gradient.</p> 
    <p>We firstly focus on the niche overlap between pairs of species. If competitive exclusion is the primary factor in determining community composition, observed overlap between pairs of species will be lower than expected at random. If environmental filtering effects predominate, observed overlap will be higher than expected at random. The lack of a significant difference from expected at random may indicate either a balance between the two mechanisms (competitive exclusion and environmental filtering) or that neutral processes control community assembly [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref023" ref-type="bibr">
      23
     </xref>]. Therefore, we can test the assembly processes by comparing actual niche overlap in the fields with that expected at random in a null model along the environmental gradients [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref024" ref-type="bibr">
      24
     </xref>].</p> 
    <p>Second, neutral theory predicts that all individuals are assumed to be functionally equivalent [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref006" ref-type="bibr">
      6
     </xref>]. Therefore, there is no relationship between species functional traits and their relative abundance. In contrast, niche theory suggests that a mechanistic model based on functional traits could predict patterns of species relative abundance. We investigated the relationship between three leaf functional traits and species relative abundance: (1) specific leaf area (SLA, the ratio of water-saturated leaf area to leaf dry mass; (2) leaf total nitrogen concentration (LNC) and (3) leaf dry matter content (LDMC, the ratio of leaf dry mass to water-saturated fresh mass). SLA is an important variable in comparative plant ecology because it is closely related with relative growth rate [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref025" ref-type="bibr">
      25
     </xref>] and leaf net assimilation rate [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref026" ref-type="bibr">
      26
     </xref>]; it is also a good predictor of plant response to resource availability [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref027" ref-type="bibr">
      27
     </xref>]. LNC is closely correlated with protein concentrations involved in photosynthesis as well as leaf growth and defense strategies [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref028" ref-type="bibr">
      28
     </xref>]. LDMC is tied to plant nutrient retention and water [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref029" ref-type="bibr">
      29
     </xref>]. Fast growing species from nutrient-rich habitats usually have high SLA, high LNC and low LDMC, while opposite trends characterize species from nutrient-poor habitats [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref030" ref-type="bibr">
      30
     </xref>]. These responses reflect a fundamental trade-off (leaf economics spectrum) between traits related to nutrient conservation and traits related to nutrient acquisition and turnover [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref031" ref-type="bibr">
      31
     </xref>].</p> 
    <p>Based on the above two hypotheses, the main objectives of this study were to: (a) determine empirically the relative importance of niche and neutral processes along a fertilization gradient; and (b) evaluate whether soil resource availability alters the relationship between leaf functional traits and species relative abundance in this alpine meadow.</p>

     <p>Thirty-six 4 × 10-m<sup>2</sup> plots composed of four fertilization levels with nine replicates were distributed in nine columns and four rows with a randomized block design. Each plot was separated from the others by a 2-m buffer strip. The fertilization treatments were generated with different amounts of (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> HPO<sub>4</sub> fertilizer applied annually at the beginning of the growing season (usually in the middle of May) from 2007 to 2010. The fertilizer was applied during a moderate rain event to avoid artificial watering [

     <p>Community measurements were conducted from 2 to 4 Sept 2010 when biomass reaches its peak. One 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> quadrat was harvested from the 4 × 4 m subplot in each plot. The quadrat location was randomly selected with the constraint that it was at least 0.5 m from the margin to avoid edge effects. We estimated the cover of each species in each quadrat before being clipped and brought to the lab. For clonal species, an individual plant was defined as a group of tillers connected by a crown [

     <p>In each plot, we measured light with a Decagon Sunfleck ceptometer (Decagon, Pullman, Washington, DC) at the time of vegetation monitoring on 2 Sept 2011. Light readings were taken on a cloudless day (11:00–13:00h). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was recorded at 10cm above the soil surface and at the top of the canopy. The ratio between these two measurements was taken as a proxy for PAR reaching the understory.</p>

     <p>We randomly sampled 2 individuals and 6 mature leaves (3 leaves per individual) at flowering time for each of the 25 species in each 4 × 6 m subplot. That is, 18 individuals and 54 mature leaves were measured for each of the 25 species in each fertilization level. Leaves were scanned to measure leaf area in the field, and fresh weight of leaves was determined with a balance (Acculab Lt-320; Acculab, Measurement Standards Inc., Danvers, MA, USA). Following these measurements, leaves were placed in paper bags and dried in the sun. Leaf samples were oven-dried at 80°C for 48 h in the laboratory and their dry masses were measured on a semianalytical balance with an accuracy of 10<sup>−4</sup> g (Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany). Dried leaves samples were ground using a ball mill (NM200; Retsch, Haan, Germany).

    <p>We used one-way ANOVA to test the effect of fertilization on PAR in the understory, species diversity (species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index), aboveground community biomass and each leaf functional trait. Then, we performed a linear regression modeling to test the relationship between functional traits and species relative abundance. Independent manipulation of SLA, LDMC and LNC would be required to truly disentangle these effects. Although this approach is correlative in nature, it can provide a way to test the importance of these mechanisms (functional traits-based niche assembly and dispersal-based neutral assembly). All variables met the statistical assumptions (residuals normality, homogeneity of variance and data linearity) when tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test and Levene’s test, respectively. These analyses were performed with SPSS15.0.</p>

    <p>Plant ecologists have long concentrated on explaining the decline of species diversity along artificial fertilization gradients [

      10
     </xref>]. Consistent with these studies, our results demonstrated that species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index significantly decreased with increased community biomass along a fertilization gradient. We have used a hypothesis-based approach to test the relative importance of niche versus neutral processes in explaining species diversity loss after fertilization. Our results showed that niche and neutral processes may together determine species loss due to fertilization in an alpine meadow community (
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.t003" ref-type="table">
      Table 3

     <xref rid="pone.0134560.g005" ref-type="fig">
      Fig 5
     </xref>).</p> 
    <p>The question of whether functional traits can determine species relative abundance has intrigued ecologists for several decades, and the results have varied substantially [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref035" ref-type="bibr">
      35
     </xref>, 
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref036" ref-type="bibr">
      36
     </xref>]. Shipley [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref037" ref-type="bibr">
      37
     </xref>] recently proposed a ‘community assembly through trait selection’ (CATS) model. This model predicts that species relative abundances are constrained by their functional traits, but with a strong stochastic component that recognizes the importance of chance events affecting community composition. Cornwell and Ackerly [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref038" ref-type="bibr">
      38
     </xref>] found that functional trait–species abundance relationships mainly depend on the measured scale. No significant relationships were found at a landscape scale; the significant relationships appeared at a local scale. Reader [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref039" ref-type="bibr">
      39
     </xref>] found that species relative abundances correlated with plant growth rate, shoot mass, root to shoot radio, and leaf palatability in infertile ridge top habitats; but Lloret et al. [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref040" ref-type="bibr">
      40
     </xref>] found that plant life history traits appeared to play an unimportant role in influencing species abundance in Mediterranean islands. In this study, we found significant relationships between species abundance and three functional traits at lower fertilization gradient. In contrast, we found no significant relationship between traits and abundance at higher fertilization gradients. Our findings were partially consistent with the model prediction [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref036" ref-type="bibr">
      36
     </xref>, 
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref041" ref-type="bibr">

     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref042" ref-type="bibr">
      42
     </xref>]. Our results demonstrated that the functional traits-species abundance relationships are dependent on environmental context (soil nutrient and light). At low or moderate soil nutrient, species traits and trade-offs in community could be the determinant of species abundance or dominance. However, there will be no correlation between abundance and traits at high soil nutrient due to a series of stochastic events. For example, species must be tolerant of low light to survive under the canopy. In addition, the pattern of traits and abundance will depend on the spatial and temporal frequency distribution of microenvironments as well as the connection between traits and microenvironments [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref043" ref-type="bibr">
      43

    <p>Plant functional traits can reflect evolutionarily derived strategies of resource capture and species interactions, which influence community composition and structure [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref044" ref-type="bibr">
      44
     </xref>, 
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref045" ref-type="bibr">
      45
     </xref>]. In this study, community composition has a shift from lower fertilization gradient to higher fertilization gradient. Four years after the start of the experiment, species with higher SLA, LNC and lower LDMC have occurred together, which reflected well-characterized ecological strategies (namely to maximize resource acquisition) under low light and high nutrient environments [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref046" ref-type="bibr">
      46
     </xref>]. Species that cannot tolerate such environment pressure (shading and thus light competition) would be excluded. Meanwhile the biotic interactions gradually shift from below-ground competition dominated when soil resources are limited to above-ground competition dominated when soil resources are abundant but shading is intense along the fertilization gradients [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref003" ref-type="bibr">

     </xref>, 
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref047" ref-type="bibr">
      47
     </xref>]. The transition of competition increases above-ground productivity while decreasing the availability of light in the understory (
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.g002" ref-type="fig">
      Fig 2
     </xref>), which leads to greater mortality or competition exclusion of small-sized species [

     </xref>, 
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref049" ref-type="bibr">
      49
     </xref>]. In our study, the graminodis (e.g. 
     <italic>
      Elymus nutans
     </italic> and 
     <italic>
      Poa poophagorum
     </italic>) that were predicted to be better light competitors were abundant after fertilization due to their tall stature and high relative growth rates [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref043" ref-type="bibr">
      43
     </xref>, 
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref050" ref-type="bibr">

     </xref>–
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref052" ref-type="bibr">
      52
     </xref>]. Our results are congruent with previous studies showing that the nutrients conservation graminoids were priority selection after fertilization [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref053" ref-type="bibr">
      53
     </xref>], because graminoids generally had thinner, denser leaves than forbs [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref054" ref-type="bibr">
      54
     </xref>]. In addition, a few forbs (e.g. 
     <italic>
      Anemone rivularis
     </italic> and 
     <italic>
      Sphallerocarpus gracilis
     </italic>) ultimately survived in the understory because of their higher SLA and LNC. Harpole and Tilman [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref042" ref-type="bibr">
      42
     </xref>] also found the evidence that plant functional trait values could control species abundance along a nitrogen gradient, which is consistent with niche theory. Our recent study [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref055" ref-type="bibr">
      55
     </xref>] also found that non-neutral, trait-based processes play an important role in determining species abundance in different fertilization habitats. In particular, species that most effectively capture light (tall or higher SLA) frequently outcompete species that are less effective at light capture (forbs and species in the lower canopy or with lower SLA) [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref056" ref-type="bibr">
      56
     </xref>]. In contrast, neutral models predicted that species are essentially equivalent in their demographic rates, independently of their functional traits [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref057" ref-type="bibr">
      57
     </xref>].</p> 
    <p>Some studies have demonstrated that niche process can cause traits convergence related to habitat selection and traits divergence related to resource competition [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref023" ref-type="bibr">
      23
     </xref>]. These results were partially consistent with our findings. In this study, niche overlap was significantly higher than expected at random at lower fertilization gradients, thus providing the evidence of environmental filtering. As a consequence of environmental filtering, a significant relationship between species traits and abundance is emerged [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref058" ref-type="bibr">
      58
     </xref>]. Environmental filtering can force species to converge toward an optimum trait value and become functionally similar. After exclusion of grazing or fertilization, this meadow tends to be dominated by tall, fast-growing species (higher SLA, LNC and lower LDMC) that can develop a disproportionately large competitive effect on local resources [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref043" ref-type="bibr">
      43
     </xref>]. Some recent studies also report that fertilization can increase similarity in species composition between communities [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref059" ref-type="bibr">
      59
     </xref>]. In contrast, observed species niche overlap showed no significant difference with our randomized expectations at higher fertilization gradients thus emphasizing the evidence of neutral processes. This may arise from the balance between competitive exclusion and environmental filtering. Species with different combination of traits will ultimately emerge separation at higher fertilization gradients. Taller species (e.g. 
     <italic>
      E
     </italic>. 
     <italic>
      nutans
     </italic> and 
     <italic>
      P
     </italic>.
     <italic>
      poophagorum
     </italic>) occupy the canopy layer, yet the lower, larger SLA species (e.g. 
     <italic>
      A
     </italic>. 
     <italic>
      rivularis
     </italic> and 
     <italic>
      S
     </italic>. 
     <italic>
      gracilis
     </italic>) dominated in the understory. In our previous study [
     <xref rid="pone.0134560.ref060" ref-type="bibr">
      60
     </xref>], we have found that the trait-based deterministic process and dispersal-based stochastic process may be equally important in structuring plant community in different habitats. At the same time, this result also confirms that species with different traits can co-exist because of contrasted shade tolerances and N utilization strategies [

    <title>Conclusion</title> 
    <p>By evaluating the niche overlaps and the relationship between species abundance and functional traits along a fertilization gradient, we found that fertilization significantly increased the overlaps of biomass at lower fertilization gradients. However, with increased fertilization gradient, there were no significant correlations between species functional traits and relative abundance. We concluded that niche and neutral processes may together determine species diversity loss in response to fertilization.</p>
