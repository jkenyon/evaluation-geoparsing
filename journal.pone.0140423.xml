     <abstract> 
      <p>Because industrial agriculture keeps expanding in Southeast Asia at the expense of natural forests and traditional swidden systems, comparing biodiversity and ecosystem services in the traditional forest–swidden agriculture system vs. monocultures is needed to guide decision making on land-use planning. Focusing on tree diversity, soil erosion control, and climate change mitigation through carbon storage, we surveyed vegetation and monitored soil loss in various land-use areas in a northern Bornean agricultural landscape shaped by swidden agriculture, rubber tapping, and logging, where various levels and types of disturbance have created a fine mosaic of vegetation from food crop fields to natural forest. Tree species diversity and ecosystem service production were highest in natural forests. Logged-over forests produced services similar to those of natural forests. Land uses related to the swidden agriculture system largely outperformed oil palm or rubber monocultures in terms of tree species diversity and service production. Natural and logged-over forests should be maintained or managed as integral parts of the swidden system, and landscape multifunctionality should be sustained. Because natural forests host a unique diversity of trees and produce high levels of ecosystem services, targeting carbon stock protection, e.g. through financial mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), will synergistically provide benefits for biodiversity and a wide range of other services. However, the way such mechanisms could benefit communities must be carefully evaluated to counter the high opportunity cost of conversion to monocultures that might generate greater income, but would be detrimental to the production of multiple ecosystem services.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title> 
    <p>Drastic land-use transformations have occurred in the tropical forest landscapes of Southeast Asia in the past decades, leading to the disappearance of natural forests and the replacement of traditional land-use systems with monoculture plantations. On the island of Borneo, the lowland rainforests are at the crossroads of multiple and divergent interests. While these rainforests are hotspots of biological diversity with a high rate of endemism and hold important carbon stocks, they are also a major source of valuable timber, and are situated on lands that are very suitable for conversion to oil palm or other large industrial plantations [

    <p>Since the late 1960s, logging has affected most of the lowland forests [
     <xref rid="pone.0140423.ref004" ref-type="bibr">
      4
     </xref>]. Following the boom era that lasted roughly until the 2000s, large areas of logged-over forest were left unmanaged. Although several studies demonstrated the important role that these forests play in supporting biodiversity and maintaining multiple ecosystem services [

     </xref>–
     <xref rid="pone.0140423.ref008" ref-type="bibr">
      8
     </xref>], they were slowly depleted through illegal logging and finally converted to oil palm plantations [
     <xref rid="pone.0140423.ref009" ref-type="bibr">
      9
     </xref>]. The detrimental effect of such large-scale land clearing on biodiversity and other services is an accepted premise [

     </xref>–
     <xref rid="pone.0140423.ref013" ref-type="bibr">
      13
     </xref>]. At the same time, as the extent of industrial agricultural areas keeps increasing, the role of traditional agricultural systems (swidden i.e., slash-and-burn and rotational fallow farming, and smallholder agroforestry systems) vs. alternative agricultural systems in providing goods and services has received much attention [
     <xref rid="pone.0140423.ref014" ref-type="bibr">

     </xref>–
     <xref rid="pone.0140423.ref017" ref-type="bibr">
      17
     </xref>]. To date, however, there has been little consensus about their role in supporting biodiversity and producing ecosystem services.</p> 
    <p>Since negative correlations usually exist between goods and services (e.g. [

     </xref>,
     <xref rid="pone.0140423.ref019" ref-type="bibr">
      19
     </xref>]), human-modified land-use areas would not be expected to produce levels of services similar to those of natural forests. Yet, in Sumatra, under low management intensity conditions, mature rubber gardens were found to have a plant species richness similar to that of nearby natural or secondary forests and to store substantial amounts of carbon in aboveground biomass [

     </xref>,
     <xref rid="pone.0140423.ref020" ref-type="bibr">
      20
     </xref>]. Swidden fallows were also shown to reduce soil erosion and contribute to soil nutrient cycling to levels similar to those found in natural forests [

     </xref>–
     <xref rid="pone.0140423.ref023" ref-type="bibr">
      23
     </xref>]. In contrast, studies in West Kalimantan found that an increasing number of shifting cultivation cycles naturally led to a decrease in tree species richness and important tree composition changes [
     <xref rid="pone.0140423.ref024" ref-type="bibr">
      24
     </xref>]. Some argue that such human-modified land use will not allow any long-term conservation goal to be fulfilled, partly because maintaining tree diversity might hinder rubber garden productivity [
     <xref rid="pone.0140423.ref025" ref-type="bibr">
      25
     </xref>]. Overall, despite current debates about the capacity of human-modified landscapes to protect biodiversity and support ecosystem services, these landscapes are getting increasing attention for their contribution to biodiversity conservation in the global context of vanishing natural habitats [

    <p>Research gaps concerning the effect of land-use changes on the ecosystem services produced by swidden systems have been identified through a systematic review currently under progress that aims to bring unbiased evidence to the debate [
     <xref rid="pone.0140423.ref028" ref-type="bibr">
      28
     </xref>]. While demand for food and goods is growing worldwide, and biodiversity and services are being lost [
     <xref rid="pone.0140423.ref029" ref-type="bibr">
      29
     </xref>], such information is essential to building sound land management strategies and guiding decision making on land-use planning.</p> 
    <p>In this study, we address the following question: What level of biodiversity and ecosystem services are found in the different land uses related to the traditional forest–swidden agriculture system? We conducted a case study from a northern Bornean agricultural landscape where we quantitatively estimated the contribution of various land uses to: (1) climate change mitigation through carbon storage in live aboveground biomass and topsoil, (2) tree species diversity, and (3) soil erosion control. The two services were chosen because of their relevance for multiple beneficiaries at different scales (local to regional for soil erosion control, and global for climate change mitigation). Tree species diversity, which we did not consider as an ecosystem service, was chosen because of its cross-cutting and cross-scale nature, as it jointly influences the delivery of goods (e.g. food, raw material, fruit, and timber for local people) and services (e.g. water regulation at the regional scale) [

     <p>This site was chosen because of the diversity of land uses representative of northern Bornean traditional agricultural systems that were found within a limited perimeter (ca. 2 km W–E by 5 km N–S). Traditionally, the main crop, rice, is cultivated along with other annual crops (such as cassava, maize, etc.) in swiddens from either primary or secondary forest clearing before the plot is abandoned after 1−2 years of cultivation. Rubber seedlings and saplings, which are planted in some crop fields during the cultivation phase or just after plot abandonment, eventually lead to rubber-based secondary forests (also called “jungle rubber” gardens) as a result of plant succession. Past and current uses of land by the local community (swidden agriculture system mixed with rubber gardens) and past logging activities have created a mosaic of vegetation reflecting various disturbance types, ages and intensities in the Keluin area.</p>

      <italic>
       Oryza sativa
      </italic> L.), is planted after using the slash-and-burn method on the initial vegetation (natural forest or secondary vegetation), (2) young secondary regrowth following field abandonment after crops have been cultivated for 1 or 2 years, (3) old secondary regrowth forests further into the process of vegetation succession following field abandonment, (4) young rubber gardens resulting from the planting of rubber seedlings and saplings (

       Hevea brasiliensis
      </italic> (Willd. ex A.Juss.) Müll.Arg.) in some young fallows, (5) old rubber gardens with complex stand structure, (6) logged-over forest that was selectively logged from 1997 to 2005, and (7) natural forest with very little human disturbance.</p> 
     <p>Two distinct sets of vegetation and erosion plots were established based on a multi-stratified sampling first across land-use type and second across disturbance age for stands regenerating after slash and burn (see

Plots for the vegetation sampling were scattered across the study area to encompass the variability of topographical situation (ridge, slope, valley bottom) and slope steepness (from flat to very steep) present in this low-elevation hilly landscape. Plots for the erosion protocol were also scattered across the study area, with the additional constraint of having a homogenous slope of ca. 40% (ca. 22°). We chose relatively steep slopes (compared with the standard slope, i.e. 9%, of a typical erosion monitoring method such as the Wischmeier plot [

Plots were contiguous but staggered down the slope for natural forest (all fitting in a 100 × 400 m area). For logged-over forest, they were scattered on either side of a former logging road built on a ridge, ca. 20 m downslope from the road.</p> 
     <p>All trees with diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.3 m) ≥ 5 cm were measured, tagged and mapped, and their height estimated, following standard procedures [

Leaf samples were collected at least once for each vernacular name (consistently given by the same group of highly knowledgeable local people using the Iban language) for both young and old secondary regrowth areas and rubber gardens, and for every individual tree for natural and logged-over forests. Identification of the herbarium vouchers were carried out at the Herbarium Bogoriense in Bogor, Indonesia.</p> 
     <p>We used three different indices to characterize tree species diversity at the plot level: species richness, Berger–Parker index, and Fisher's α. Species richness is the simplest measure of species diversity but does not take into account community evenness. Conversely, the Berger–Parker index (defined as the inverse of the proportion of individuals of the most common species in the community) depends only on evenness, and is sensitive to the dominance of a few species. Fisher's α is mathematically unrelated to the first two indices, is relatively independent of sample size, and is insensitive to the presence of rare species [

We did not monitor soil loss on bare soil elements created by logging activities (e.g. dirt roads, landslides) or related to rubber tapping (e.g. walking tracks) that are known to contribute to erosion at the landscape scale disproportionately compared to their geographically restricted areas [

Since extreme rainfall events that occur while soil is temporarily bare can lead to dramatic soil loss, soil loss monitoring before, during and after disturbance is required to follow soil erosion control during land-use change [

     <title>Logged-over forests and swidden agriculture system outperform monocultures in terms of service production</title> 
     <p>In addition to the need to preserve natural forests, another challenge is to maximize service production in human-modified land-use areas. With the noticeable exception of tree species richness and tree species composition, our data did not show significant differences in service production between logged-over forests, old rubber gardens and old secondary regrowth forests. Tree species richness is high in logged-over forests (one plot can simultaneously host a mixture of old growth and secondary species), but in such forests, aboveground carbon stocks are low. In contrast, aboveground carbon stocks can be large in some old rubber gardens and secondary regrowth forests, but tree species richness is low. Beyond the diversity of products from these land-use types, there is a complementarity in services produced by such human-modified landscapes. Despite continuous changes in land use and management, the diversification of human activities—farming, rubber tapping, and logging—ensures the sustained delivery of multiple services.</p>

     <p>We found that carbon storage and tree diversity increased along a successional recovery of the forest after initial clearance: levels of service production were lowest in food crop fields, intermediate in young rubber gardens and secondary regrowth areas, and highest in old rubber gardens and secondary regrowth forests. More striking was no trend for carbon storage in topsoil and the slow recovery of different ecosystem services, either in old rubber gardens or secondary regrowth forests. Mean time since last disturbance for our old secondary regrowth forest plots was 47 years, and yet species richness was still significantly lower than for natural forests. Similarly, we found low similarity in tree species composition between old secondary regrowth forest and natural forest plots.</p>

The whole swidden agriculture system is sustainable if the condition that sufficient time is allowed for soil and vegetation to recover is met. Soil impoverishment related to reduction in rotation length is a serious threat likely to jeopardize the production of goods and services in the long-term from the traditional swidden system in the Keluin area.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title> 
    <p>In such a rapidly transforming traditional rural landscape in northern Bornean, natural forests host highly unique tree species diversity, have the lowest erosion rate, and store significantly more carbon (in aboveground biomass and topsoil) than do any other land-use type. Logged-over forests provide services similar to natural forest, except for soil erosion control, which is jeopardized by the presence of the remaining decaying road network that leads to soil loss at the landscape level.</p> 
    <p>All land uses related to the swidden agriculture system largely outperform oil palm or rubber monocultures in terms of tree diversity, carbon storage, and soil erosion control. Natural and logged-over forests should be maintained or managed as an integral part of the swidden system, and landscape multifunctionality should be sustained as a safety net against the price volatility of traded goods (e.g. rubber, palm oil, timber, tengkawang oil), upon which the economy of monocrop systems is much more dependent.</p> 
    <p>Because of the congruence of services in natural forest, protection of their carbon stocks, for example through financial mechanisms such as REDD+, will synergistically benefit biodiversity and a wide range of other services provided to communities in this area. However, how such mechanisms could benefit communities must be carefully evaluated to counter the high opportunity cost of conversion to monocultures; these may generate greater income, but may also be more detrimental to the production of multiple ecosystem services.</p> 
    <p>Ecosystem service recovery time following initial slash-and-burn practices on the vegetation is longer in the study area than has been reported in the literature for similar study situations. As rotation length appears to be a key factor in the sustainability of swidden systems, it is critical to understand the socio-cultural and economic drivers of the reduction in rotation length and the potential feedback of this reduction on social–ecological systems. In the rapidly transforming socio-environmental context of this region, questions remain about the long-term persistence of the swidden agriculture system.</p>
