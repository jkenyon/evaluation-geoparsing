     <abstract> 
      <p>Understanding the ecological mechanisms driving beta diversity is a major goal of community ecology. Metacommunity theory brings new ways of thinking about the structure of local communities, including processes occurring at different spatial scales. In addition to new theories, new methods have been developed which allow the partitioning of individual and shared contributions of environmental and spatial effects, as well as identification of species and sites that have importance in the generation of beta diversity along ecological gradients. We analyzed the spatial distribution of dung beetle communities in areas of Atlantic Forest in a mainland-island scenario in southern Brazil, with the objective of identifying the mechanisms driving composition, abundance and biomass at three spatial scales (mainland-island, areas and sites). We sampled 20 sites across four large areas, two on the mainland and two on the island. The distribution of our sampling sites was hierarchical and areas are isolated. We used standardized protocols to assess environmental heterogeneity and sample dung beetles. We used spatial eigenfunctions analysis to generate the spatial patterns of sampling points. Environmental heterogeneity showed strong variation among sites and a mild increase with increasing spatial scale. The analysis of diversity partitioning showed an increase in beta diversity with increasing spatial scale. Variation partitioning based on environmental and spatial variables suggests that environmental heterogeneity is the most important driver of beta diversity at the local scale. The spatial effects were significant only at larger spatial scales. Our study presents a case where environmental heterogeneity seems to be the main factor structuring communities at smaller scales, while spatial effects are more important at larger scales. The increase in beta diversity that occurs at larger scales seems to be the result of limitation in species dispersal ability due to habitat fragmentation and the presence of geographical barriers.</p>

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Ricklefs1">
      [5]
     </xref>. Community structure may be influenced by several ecological processes that involve biotic and abiotic factors operating at different spatial and temporal scales

     </xref>–
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Wilson1">
      [8]
     </xref>. When we consider large scales, historical, evolutionary and stochastic processes become critical to the understanding of these patterns 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Ricklefs1">
      [5]

     </xref>–
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Ricklefs2">
      [11]
     </xref>. Further, studying only local processes may not be sufficient for understanding how communities are structured locally and regionally 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Ricklefs1">
      [5]
     </xref>, because local and regional processes may act in different ways in relation to the increase or decrease in species diversity 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Ricklefs2">
      [11]
     </xref>.</p> 
    <p>Despite the large number of mechanisms (theories and models) proposed as drivers of patterns of species distribution, only four processes are fundamentally involved: selection, drift, speciation and dispersal 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Vellend1">
      [2]
     </xref>. Three main hypotheses are proposed to explain the origin of beta diversity (i.e., variation in the identities and relative abundance of species among sites) with respect to these processes 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Legendre2">
      [12]
     </xref>. The first hypothesis suggests that the species composition may be stable over large areas, and that biological interactions (e.g., competition inter- and/or intraspecific) play an important role in maintaining beta diversity 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Legendre2">
      [12]
     </xref>. The second hypothesis states that species composition varies in a random and autocorrelated way, emphasizing spatially limited dispersal 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Legendre2">
      [12]
     </xref>. The last hypothesis suggests that species distribution is driven by environmental conditions, and that landscapes are mosaics in which local environmental drivers control species composition 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Legendre2">
      [12]
     </xref>. These hypotheses seem to be somewhat related regardless of the organismal group or ecosystem, and testing them is crucial for elucidating issues on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity conservation initiatives 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Legendre2">
      [12]
     </xref>.</p> 
    <p>In community ecology there exists a variety of concepts and methodologies commonly employed by ecologists to measure beta diversity and to identify the processes related to its generation 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Legendre2">
      [12]
     </xref>–
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Tuomisto2">
      [17]
     </xref>. Recent approaches have been based on the dependence of environmental, spatial and random processes, with the goal of explaining which processes have more influence on beta diversity, e.g., by using variation partitioning methods 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-PeresNeto1">
      [18]
     </xref> on composition or abundance community data among groups of explanatory variables (e.g., environmental and spatial) 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Legendre2">
      [12]
     </xref>. These methods are used to attempt to explain how beta diversity is influenced by environmental and/or spatial factors, or by random factors 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Borcard1">
      [19]
     </xref>. Despite being criticized 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Gilbert1">
      [20]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Smith1">
      [21]
     </xref>, variation partitioning has long been used in the context of metacommunity theory 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Leibold1">
      [1]
     </xref> and it highlights the importance of increasing the spatial scale in understanding the ecological processes structuring biological communities locally and regionally 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Holyoak1">
      [22]
     </xref>.</p> 
    <p>A metacommunity is defined as a set of communities connected by the dispersal of multiple interacting species 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Leibold1">
      [1]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Holyoak1">
      [22]
     </xref>. There are four theoretical paradigms (models) to explain metacommunity dynamics (species sorting, mass effects, patch dynamics and neutral) and they take into account three (drift, selection and dispersal) of the four basic processes aforementioned 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Vellend1">
      [2]
     </xref>; differences in species dispersal ability and environmental characteristics are important factors for determining which model best describes the metacommunity 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Leibold1">
      [1]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Holyoak1">
      [22]
     </xref>. Mass effects (high dispersal) and patch dynamics (low dispersal) would be variations of species sorting (efficient dispersal), as there are different levels of dispersal ability of species in each metacommunity model 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Winegardner1">
      [23]
     </xref>. The adoption of metacommunity theory has led to substantial changes in the way that ecologists interpret ecological phenomena at both local and metacommunity (regional) scales 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Leibold1">
      [1]
     </xref>.</p> 
    <p>A key point in assessing the relative importance of proposed metacommunity processes is the identification and use of environmental and/or spatial gradients as study scenarios 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Legendre2">
      [12]
     </xref>. Direct gradient ordination techniques (e.g., redundancy analysis) followed by variation partitioning 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-PeresNeto1">
      [18]
     </xref> allows determination of the fraction of beta diversity explained solely by environmental or spatial predictors, and by shared effects of both sets of predictors 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Legendre2">
      [12]
     </xref>. The prevalence of environmental effects indicates species sorting, the predominance of spatial effects indicates neutral processes, historical events and/or dispersal limitation, and shared effects of both environmental and spatial predictors indicate species sorting, dispersal limitation or a combination of both (mass effects and patch dynamics sensu 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Leibold1">
      [1]

     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Cottenie1">
      [24]
     </xref>. The relative importance of metacommunity paradigms is still dependent on spatial scale, spatial extent or spatial distances between sites 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Declerck1">
      [25]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Heino1">
      [26]
     </xref>, and varies between environments and groups of species due to inherent differences of ecosystem type and species dispersal ability 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Logue1">
      [27]
     </xref>. Recent techniques have also allowed the identification of species and sites that may contribute to beta diversity along an ecological gradient by using community dataset total variance as an estimate of beta diversity

    <p>The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one the most threatened biomes in terms of biodiversity conservation 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Myers1">
      [28]
     </xref>. About 12% of its original size, it is highly fragmented with a high degree of isolation, existing primarily in intermediate successional state 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Ribeiro1">
      [29]
     </xref>. Less than 2% of Atlantic Forest areas are located in protected zones 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Ribeiro1">

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Tabarelli1">
      [30]
     </xref>. Historically, the coast of Brazil has always showed the highest population and industrial concentration, and thus, the Atlantic Forest has been affected by the growth and development of the country

An understanding of how species respond to anthropogenic modifications to the structure or complexity of habitats is fundamental for the development of future conservation initiatives, especially for organisms that play key roles in the maintenance and/or restoration of ecosystems, such as dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae).</p>

    <p>Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of spatial scales on the patterns of species diversity of dung beetles in Brazilian Atlantic Forest and to identify the mechanisms that drive these patterns applying aspects of metacommunity theory. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of dung beetles in the Atlantic Forest is associated with differences in forest structure and that high levels of beta diversity will be found with increasing spatial scale due to dispersal limitation. Our predictions are as follows: (i) because dung beetles are sensitive to environmental changes, environmental gradients should result in high beta diversity among sites via species sorting, (ii) due to differences in habitat structure of each site, environmental characteristics and dung beetle species distribution are spatially structured, (iii) because of dispersal limitation among areas (mainland-island and fragmented landscape), the spatial effect has high importance in structuring communities at increased spatial scales.</p>

On the mainland, the areas sampled were within the Environmental Protection Area of Anhatomirim in Governador Celso Ramos city (ANH, 27°25′1″S, 48°34′25″W), and in Permanent Protection Area in Itapema city (ITA, 27°05′13″S, 48°35′54″W). According to the Brazilian Forest Code (Law n°. 12.651/2012), permanent protection areas are sites with characteristics that have the environmental function of preserving water, biodiversity resources, and landscape and geological stability, and for facilitation floral and faunal gene flow. The distance among areas is approximately 21 km between PER and RAT, 34 km between PER and ANH, 71 km between PER and ITA, 13.5 km between ANH and RAT, 50 km between ITA and RAT, and 37 km between ANH and ITA. The altitude of the sampling sites ranged between 28 and 265 m. All sites sampled are near the Brazilian Atlantic coastline and have dense rain forest vegetation within the Atlantic Forest biome, with various levels of vegetation succession

A mixture (300 ml) of water and detergent (neutral) was added to each container to catch and kill insects. We used human feces and rotting flesh (aged in plastic container at room temperature three days prior to sampling) as bait to attract dung beetles, as both satisfy the two main eating habits of dung beetles – coprophagy and necrophagy, respectively

Due to the spatial configuration of our sampling design, the large distance among the four areas, and the effect of spatial discontinuity between mainland-island, the sampling sites showed a hierarchical distribution. Thus, it was possible to investigate the variation in dung beetle communities at three spatial scales, i.e. mainland-island, areas, and sites. Sites represent the local spatial scale, i.e., the smallest spatial extent in our study that encompasses five sampling points. Areas represent the intermediate spatial scale with five sites per area. Mainland-island represents the regional spatial scale, i.e., the largest spatial extent in our study that encompasses two areas each one. Variation in dung beetle species composition, number of individuals, and dry biomass was used to assess the influence of environmental and spatial factors at each spatial scale.</p>

Briefly, a plastic pipes crossing in an x-shape were placed in the center of each pair of traps (i.e., at each sampling point), dividing the sampling point into four quadrants (northwest, southwest, southeast and northeast). Tree, shrub and soil environmental variables were measured in each quadrant as follows: (1) circumference at breast height when diameter at breast height &gt;5 cm), (2) height, (3) top diameter and (4) distance away from the nearest tree to the center of cross, (5–8) same measures for the greater tree distant up to 10 m, (9–12) similar measures for shrubs (circumference at ankle height when &lt;5 cm and with a minimum height of 1 m), (13) land slope, (14) canopy cover, (15) percentage of leaf litter cover, (16) green cover and (17) exposed soil, (18) height and (19) dry biomass of leaf litter, and (20) altitude.</p> 
     <p>The height of trees and shrubs was visually estimated with a ruler of 4 m length. Circumference and distance were measured with a millimeter tape measure. The percentage of litter, green cover, and exposed soil coverage in each quadrant was estimated in different classes (0–5, 6–25, 26–50, 51–75, 76–95, 96–100%) using a square of 1 m plastic pipes, placed about 20 cm away from the cross. Land slope was obtained at the center of the square using an inclinometer. Litter height was measured using a mm ruler at five points inside the square (near each corner and in the center). A five-inch square was constructed in the center of the 1 m square, and a portion of litter was removed. Litter was later dried in an oven (60°C for 72 hours) and weighed to obtain dry biomass. Using the same classes described above, the percentage of canopy cover was visually estimated using a hollow square of 10 cm side length, placed at a distance of 60 cm from the eye of the observer at a 20° angle in relation to the zenith

For each variable, a measure of central tendency was calculated based on the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Thus, each environmental variable represented a central value (mean or median, as appropriate) of the four measures of each point; this was done to minimize the effects of visual estimation.

     <p>The hierarchical partitioning analysis of diversity based on species richness data showed a large contribution of regional (β3 = 5 species) and local (β1 = 4.4 species) spatial scales to gamma diversity (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111883-g002">
       Figure 2

A similar pattern was observed for Shannon entropy based on species abundance. The hierarchical partitioning of diversity analysis also indicated a small contribution of β2, and a large relative contribution of β3 and β1, respectively.</p>

     <title>Species and local contributions to beta diversity index</title> 
     <p>The partitioning of the total variance in components of the contribution of species and sites to beta diversity showed different results when data on composition, abundance and biomass of dung beetles were analyzed. For composition, the total sum of squares (SS<sub>Total</sub>) was 38.183 and the index of variance of beta diversity (BD<sub>Total</sub>) was 0.395 for dung beetle data across all sampling sites. SCBD values ranged between 0.002 and 0.145, and 10 species contributed above the mean (0.047) to beta diversity (

     <p>At the mainland-island scale, analysis of the variation in species composition based on biomass showed that both environmental and spatial effects were significant (

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Simmons1">
      [31]
     </xref>, including new approaches suggested by metacommunity theory. Our results represent a first step towards a better understanding of the relative importance of ecological processes on dung beetle community structure in a coastal mainland-island landscape across three different spatial scales.</p> 
    <p>In this study, the environmental heterogeneity had greater importance at smaller scales, and may be the cause of high beta diversity in terms of species richness and abundance (i.e., Shannon entropy) found among sampling sites. Local environmental factors seem to be crucial in the structuring of local communities; such factors may be responsible for high beta diversity at the local scale, as has been demonstrated for several groups of organisms in a variety of ecosystems 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Declerck1">
      [25]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Cottenie2">
      [72]
     </xref>–
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Tews1">
      [77]
     </xref>. Thus, the ecological gradient evaluated here appears to have a distribution defined by spatially structured environmental heterogeneity, which may have strong effects on dung beetle community structure locally.</p> 
    <p>Beta diversity at the area scale was lower than at the site scale, despite the increase in geographic distance among the sampling points. At area scale, we found a significantly greater importance of spatial effects compared to environmental effects, even after the analysis of individual effects of the models. Beta diversity among areas appears to be mainly related to the spatial patterns of the sampling sites. The occurrence of shared environmental and spatial effects as drivers of beta diversity are very common with increasing spatial scale 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Cottenie1">
      [24]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Gianuca1">
      [75]
     </xref>, and these shared effects may suggest significant limitations in species dispersal ability between site and area scales. Besides environmental effects, spatial limitation may be related to geographic distance, lack of connectivity caused by fragmentation, or the landscape structure between the mainland and the island.</p> 
    <p>Between the mainland and the island, beta diversity showed the highest values and at this scale only the environmental model was significant for species composition, while for abundance the environmental and spatial models were significant. The high beta diversity found between the mainland and the island has its origin at site and area scales, where environmental and spatial patterns have high relative importance. Thus, we observed that the distribution of dung beetles along an ecological gradient occurs in a spatially structured environment, where such patterns may be generated due to dispersal limitation at intermediate scales, and due to environmental heterogeneity at local scales.</p> 
    <p>The distribution pattern of dung beetle species composition was associated with the altitude gradient. This variable was significant at all scales studied after spatial effects were removed, demonstrating its strong influence on the species composition of dung beetle communities. Altitude ranged between 28 and 265 m among sampling sites. A study performed in the Colombian Andes demonstrated that dung beetle composition varied along an altitude gradient between 1,000 and 2,250 m at intervals of roughly 250 m 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Escobar1">
      [78]
     </xref>; the differences found in this study were associated with different environmental adaptations of the species. Environmental and climatic differences are also important for dung beetle distribution at low altitudes. The proximity to the sea and the effect of wind on humidity 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Hernndez1">
      [46]
     </xref>, and soils with higher salt concentration, although not measured in our study, could also affect the relative success of some species. Thus, the environmental and spatial configuration of sampling sites evaluated in the mainland-island landscape may influence the distribution of dung beetle species.</p> 
    <p>Except for at the mainland-island scale, in general species composition and abundance showed similar responses to the ecological gradient studied. However, the relative importance of the models was greater for abundance data. Although abundance may not sufficiently explain patterns of species distribution (i.e., due to confounding effects caused by highly abundant species), it may help to explain the responses of species across the environmental gradients, because it reflects changes in the relative success of each species against these gradients 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Declerck1">
      [25]
     </xref>. In our study, abundance and biomass data were explained by the same set of environmental variables, and showed very similar responses to the ecological gradients. In general, dung beetle biomass was more influenced by individual spatial effects than abundance data. Thus, biomass may be an important descriptor of changes in the relative success of dung beetles along ecological gradients, because it is mainly derived from nutrients obtained from mammal feces 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Spector1">
      [79]
     </xref>, and availability of this resource may also be affected by environmental heterogeneity.</p> 
    <p>In addition to altitude, the percentage of green cover and land slope were part of the environmental model describing the distribution of dung beetle abundance and biomass. Green cover has also been found to explain the distribution of dung beetles species in different-sized Atlantic forest fragments 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Campos1">
      [80]
     </xref>. Variation in the percentage of green cover illustrates the differences among sites with greater or fewer small plants and shrubs covering the soil. Sites with greater spacing between trees and less tree cover allow more sunlight, which may influence the microclimate and soil moisture, as shown to occur in forest edges 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Didham1">
      [81]
     </xref>. Land slope ranged between five and 36° degrees, and having some degree of slope is a common characteristic among our sampling sites, due to the fact that Atlantic Forest is typically located on hillsides with a large altitudinal range 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Ribeiro1">
      [29]
     </xref>. In another study of Atlantic Forest in Serra do Japi, located in the western region of São Paulo state’s Atlantic plateau, Brazil, dung beetle composition was shown to vary between the tops, hillsides and valleys, which are associated with differences in environmental structure 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Hernndez1">
      [46]
     </xref>. Sites with high degrees of land slope may be most affected by rainfall, and may present unfavorable soil features for some dung beetle species. These environmental characteristics may influence the distribution of dung beetles, and may have greater power to affect relative species success.</p> 
    <p>Changes in the structural complexity of forested areas may modify the entire community associated with these habitats, diminishing the species richness of some taxonomic groups and increasing the others 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Barlow1">
      [33]
     </xref>. For example, the structure of the environment was more important in determining dung beetle community composition than resource availability in areas occupied by cattle in Mexico 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Halffter2">
      [82]
     </xref>. The distribution of dung beetles along different environmental characteristics may show discrete associations typical to particular biotypes within the landscape 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Davis2">
      [83]
     </xref>. Species richness, abundance and biomass of dung beetles were negatively affected in disturbed habitats (e.g., secondary forests and 
     <italic>
      Eucalyptus
     </italic> plantations in the Brazilian Amazon) when compared to primary forest habitats 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Gardner2">
      [35]

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Feer1">
      [84]
     </xref>. Thus, many species of dung beetles have relationships with certain habitat characteristics, likely to facilitate finding mates and/or food, or could be directly related to the presence of organisms that produce their food resource.</p> 
    <p>High inter- and intraspecific competition, random distribution, and ephemeral nature of food resources together suggest, a priori, that dung beetles are probably good dispersers 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Roslin1">

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Larsen1">
      [45]
     </xref>. The authors installed pitfall traps baited with feces at different distances in a semi-deciduous tropical forest, and they found that 95% of individuals were collected up to 25 m. In contrast, using similar techniques, other authors 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Arellano1">
      [86]
     </xref> evaluated the dispersal ability of 
     <italic>
      Canthon cyanellus cyanellus
     </italic> across a Mexican landscape that contained different components such as forest fragments, hedgerows and pastures. They found a maximum movement distance among the different landscape components of 1,560 m for males (average 390 m) and 860 m for females (average 290 m), suggesting that landscape type change is not a barrier to dispersal for some species. In fact, some species from continuous Amazonian forest fragments do not extend their activities to adjacent open areas, and this effect is reduced when there is presence of secondary forest in these areas 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Klein1">
      [40]
     </xref>. We may expect a similar pattern in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.</p>

      [93]
     </xref>. During that time, the small minimum distance between mainland and island (minimum of 500 m) and low maximum depth between them (about 30 m) may have allowed a favorable environment for dispersal of the species from the mainland to the island. Site “C” of ITA is unique in that is separated from the continuous forest that occurs in each area due to fragmentation caused by a highway; it had the lowest values for species richness (five) and for number of individuals (49), and was the exclusive site of occurrence of 
     <italic>
      Coprophanaeus dardanus

    <p>Environmental control (i.e., the species sorting paradigm) seems to be the dominant structuring process in the metacommunity at the local scale. However, environment was also important at larger scales, and environmental factors were spatially structured along the ecological gradient studied. Spatial effects were more important at larger scales, where there was an increase in beta diversity that appears to be due to limitation in dispersal ability of the species due to geographic barriers and fragmented landscape. Contrary to what was found in other studies 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111883-Declerck1">
