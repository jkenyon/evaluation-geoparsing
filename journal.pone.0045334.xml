     <abstract> 
      <p>Surface water availability is a key driver of elephant impacts on biological diversity. Thus, understanding the spatio-temporal variations of these impacts in relation to water is critical to their management. However, elephant piosphere effects (i.e. the radial pattern of attenuating impact) are poorly described, with few long-term quantitative studies. Our understanding is further confounded by the complexity of systems with elephant (i.e. fenced, multiple water points, seasonal water availability, varying population densities) that likely limit the use of conceptual models to predict these impacts. Using 31 years of data on shrub structure in the succulent thickets of the Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa, we tested elephant effects at a single water point. Shrub structure showed a clear sigmoid response with distance from water, declining at both the upper and lower limits of sampling. Adjacent to water, this decline caused a roughly 300-m radial expansion of the grass-dominated habitats that replace shrub communities. Despite the clear relationship between shrub structure and ecological functioning in thicket, the extent of elephant effects varied between these features with distance from water. Moreover, these patterns co-varied with other confounding variables (e.g. the location of neighboring water points), which limits our ability to predict such effects in the absence of long-term data. We predict that elephant have the ability to cause severe transformation in succulent thicket habitats with abundant water supply and elevated elephant numbers. However, these piosphere effects are complex, suggesting that a more integrated understanding of elephant impacts on ecological heterogeneity may be required before water availability is used as a tool to manage impacts. We caution against the establishment of water points in novel succulent thicket habitats, and advocate a significant reduction in water provisioning at our study site, albeit with greater impacts at each water point.</p>

    <p>Herbivores influence vegetation dynamics at a range of spatial and temporal scales, with the intensity and heterogeneity of these effects determined by a spatio-temporal hierarchy of foraging decisions. At a landscape scale, foraging decisions made at finer-scales are constrained by both biotic and abiotic factors, including proximity to water, topography and the availability and quality of food

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-OwenSmith2">
      [7]
     </xref>. Conservation areas with abundant water supply and elevated elephant numbers are therefore vulnerable to degradation as the utilization gradients that develop around water coalesce and vegetation structure is homogenized across the landscape

      [7]
     </xref>. Thus, developing a predictive understanding of the spatial and temporal variations of elephant impacts in relation to water is key to managing these impacts. This comes at a time when conservation managers use water availability as a tool to manipulate elephant distributions in an attempt to maintain landscape heterogeneity

    <p>The (foraging and trampling) impacts of herbivores on vegetation dynamics and soil resources in relation to water, creating a piosphere effect (i.e. a radial pattern of attenuating impact), are well documented, particularly for rangelands (reviewed in 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-James1">
      [13]
     </xref>). Descriptive models of these spatial patterns are expected to show sigmoid responses, which are intuitively attractive as tools to estimate the extent of the piosphere effect (on the basis of the distance from water at which the asymptote of the curve is reached), and thus to determine the location of water points (allowing for areas of imperceptible impacts) across the landscape 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Graetz1">
      [14]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Thrash1">
      [15]
     </xref>. For herbaceous communities, these distances vary with rainfall, herbivore numbers and the proximity of neighboring watering points (e.g. 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Parker1">
      [16]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Thrash2">
      [17]
     </xref>), but this has not been tested for woody communities that may be less dynamic; neither is it clear how the extent of the piosphere effect contrasts between communities or features within a community (e.g. biomass vs. abundance) that may differ in their sensitivity to impacts. Our understanding of these variations is confounded by a lack of long-term quantitative studies on spatio-temporal variations in piospheres (e.g. 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Adler1">
      [18]
     </xref>), while conceptual models were developed for open (i.e. non-fenced) rangelands 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Graetz1">
      [14]
     </xref>. In these systems, sigmoid models are expected to show increasing displacement of asymptotes away from water (allied with declining curve steepness) as the piosphere pattern expands with continuous utilization

     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Graetz1">
      [14]
     </xref>. However, many wildlife systems, and particularly those with elephant, are more complex (i.e. fenced, multiple water points, seasonal water availability, varying population densities) such that the predicted spatio-temporal variations may not always hold 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-ChamailleJammes1">
      [19]
     </xref>, thus questioning the reliability of these models as management tools.</p> 
    <p>Despite the documented changes in vegetation structure and dynamics caused by elephant (reviewed in 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Kerley1">
      [20]
     </xref>) and the fact that these impacts intensify near water (e.g.

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Mosugelo1">
      [21]
     </xref>), elephant piosphere effects are poorly described or simply inferred. Moreover, these descriptions are largely restricted to savanna habitats and most focus on herbaceous communities that appear to be resilient to impacts (e.g. 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Parker1">
      [16]

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Thrash3">
      [22]
     </xref>); these communities also respond strongly to other environmental drivers (e.g. drought, rainfall variability), such that our understanding of the impacts may be confounded

     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Landman1">
      [23]

This highlights the need to demonstrate elephant piosphere effects across a range of habitats, focusing on the woody components.</p> 
    <p>Using 31 years of data on shrub structure in the succulent thickets of the Addo Elephant National Park (AENP), South Africa, we test spatial and temporal variations in elephant impacts at a single water point. We predict that shrub structure increases rapidly to an asymptote with distance from water, a classic piosphere effect, but that the extent of the effect varies depending on the sensitivity of the structural feature to elephant impacts 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Graetz1">
      [14]
     </xref>. With time and increasing elephant numbers, we expect the piosphere effect to expand (characterized by an increasing displacement of asymptotes away from water and declining curve steepness –

     <p>We measured the composition and structure (defined in terms of shrub volumes and densities) of the thicket shrub community along seven experimental plots located at increasing distances (100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 1500 and 3000 m) from Hapoor water point in the area of AMC originally fenced in 1954 (

Plots were permanently marked in 1977, when they were first surveyed, with further monitoring in 1981, 1989 and 2008 (providing temporal coverage of 31 years). Thus, the sampled plots experienced 23–54 years of elephant use over the experimental period, at a time when densities fluctuated between 1.0 and 4.1 elephant.km<sup>−2</sup>.Since succulent thicket is an aseasonal habitat with an evergreen shrub community 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-StuartHill2">
       [35]
      </xref>, we did not consider any seasonal variations in elephant effects.</p> 
     <p>Plots were 5 m wide, while plot length (17–45 m) scaled inversely with the abundance of the dominant shrub taxa. We estimated the volume (m<sup>3</sup>.m<sup>−2</sup>) of all canopy shrubs (24 spp.: 5 succulents, 19 woody shrubs) encountered by measuring the maximum height and canopy diameters of individual plants. Because most shrubs are multi-stemmed re-sprouters, stems within 50 cm of each other at ground-level were considered to be of the same individual. Individuals were measured if at least half the rooted area occurred within the plot. We calculated shrub density as the number of individuals per unit area.</p>

     <p>To identify the likely mechanism of the predicted change in functionality, we hypothesized that this process will be associated with a change in the structure (or integrity) of the organic-rich mounds that occur beneath patches of canopy shrubs. Hence, we considered intact mounds to be those for which patch area was equal to, or exceeded mound area and thus where resources were conserved beneath patches. The reverse was true for exposed mounds; these occurred more frequently near water, reflecting areas vulnerable to erosion. Thus, at each marked experimental plot we measured the canopy and mound diameters of ten randomly selected shrub patches and estimated patch and mound area (m<sup>2</sup>), respectively. Ratios of patch and mound area were correlated with ratios of run-on and run-off per plot.</p>

For this reason, although the results of our hypothesis tests are robust, care must be taken in over-interpreting the estimates of coefficients for individual years. Baring this in mind, our models showed a clear spatial pattern in shrub volume and density that is typical of piospheres (

    <p>AENP has a long history (nearly 40 years) of demonstrating elephant effects on ecosystem patterns and processes, and currently provides the most comprehensive account of these effects in South Africa (reviewed in

     </xref>, our study is the first to investigate these effects in relation to water in thicket. Furthermore, we provide the first explicit model of long-term variations in an elephant piosphere effect in a fenced system that may be used as a tool to monitor and manage the impact.</p> 
    <p>At our study site, we observed a clear spatial pattern in elephant effects, i.e. shrub structure increased rapidly to an asymptote with distance from water, which is consistent with other piosphere patterns (e.g. 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Graetz1">
      [14]

     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Smith1">
      [26]
     </xref>). These results expand on the conclusions of Stuart-Hill 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-StuartHill1">
      [32]
     </xref> and Kerley, Tongway and Ludwig 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Kerley2">
      [28]
     </xref> who argued that the top-down foraging of elephant maintains the structure and ecological functioning of succulent thicket. We show that in the vicinity of water, and consequently with intensive utilization, the thicket shrub community is vulnerable to transformation as shrub patches are opened up, canopy volume declines and species that are less tolerant of elephant effects (e.g. those that recruit or regenerate poorly or are vulnerable to pollarding or uprooting - 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-OConnor1">
      [47]
     </xref>) are gradually removed. This has significant implications for ecological functioning as the organic-rich mounds that occur beneath patches of shrubs are increasingly exposed and trapped resources run-off. The end-point is a highly transformed landscape adjacent to water, covered with a simple layer of ephemeral grasses and few of the structural elements that capture and utilize resources 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Kerley2">
      [28]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-LechmereOertel2">
      [48]
     </xref>. Although our results are confounded by observations at a single water point (arrayed along a single axis), they are consistent with the patterns of transformation at other water points in AMC (determined using Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVIs) – 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Smith1">
      [26]
     </xref>), and elsewhere in succulent thicket following intensive utilization by domestic browsers (e.g. 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-LechmereOertel1">
      [29]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-StuartHill1">

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-LechmereOertel2">
      [48]
     </xref>). Importantly, the latter studies show that a disturbance of the ecological processes in thicket, combined with generally slow regeneration dynamics, causes this trajectory of transformation to be virtually irreversible without active restoration. Thus, thicket landscapes with abundant water supply and elevated elephant numbers may be vulnerable to degradation (i.e. where ephemeral grasses dominate over woody shrubs, causing a decline in productivity and biodiversity – 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-LechmereOertel1">

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Gaylard1">
      [9]
     </xref>. Evidence from Hapoor water point support these predictions and show that shrub volume in particular has declined steadily at both the upper and lower limit of the piosphere pattern over the 31 year period of the survey; most striking is the roughly 300 m radial expansion of the grass-dominated habitats adjacent to water. Although Smith’s 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Smith1">
      [26]
     </xref> analysis (using NDVIs on Landsat TM imagery) was limited to areas within 1 km from water in AMC (which excluded the estimation of asymptotes), she confirmed the expansion of these grass-dominated habitats at other water points. Not surprisingly, the extent and rate of expansion varied between points, mostly in accordance with their management history, but probably also in relation to other landscape features and barriers 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Loarie1">
      [4]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Hayward1">
      [30]
     </xref>. The latter implies that the observed patterns may also not be symmetric at each point, causing inconsistencies in the shape of the piosphere pattern. For water points with management histories comparable to that of Hapoor (
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045334-g001">
      Fig. 1
     </xref>), grass cover reached distances of roughly 450 m from water, expanding by ∼300 m over a 16 year period. Lechmere-Oertel, Cowling and Kerley 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-LechmereOertel2">
      [48]
     </xref> argued that once the thicket system passes a threshold of self-restoration it loses resilience, thus tending toward an alternative state with reduced productivity 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-StuartHill2">
      [35]
     </xref>. We predict that elephant have the ability to expand the grassland-state across the landscape, and that this pattern of transformation can be interpreted using a state-and-transition model (

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Westoby1">

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-OwenSmith1">
      [5]

     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Pienaar1">
      [12]
     </xref>) may be risky in succulent thicket that is vulnerable to such disturbances.</p> 
    <p>Elephant modify ecological patterns and processes at a range of scales 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Kerley1">
      [20]
     </xref>, and while the patterns are often clear, the mechanisms may not be 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Landman1">
      [23]
     </xref>. Although elephant piosphere effects are most apparent in the structure of woody communities, the scale of effects on associated biodiversity may be different from those observed for woody vegetation. Using modeled estimates from our final survey, we show that despite the clear relationship between shrub structure and ecological functioning in succulent thicket, the extent of elephant impacts at Hapoor water point varied between these features (displacement of asymptotes during 2008: shrub volume – ∼1070 m; shrub density – ∼3760 m; functionality – ∼4890 m, but see cautionary note); we presume that this reflects differences in the sensitivity of these features to elephant. Given that water and elephants are unevenly distributed across the landscape (e.g. 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-ChamaillJammes1">
      [2]
     </xref>), it is likely that our estimates will vary between water points. Thus, it will be critically important to develop a predictive understanding of the relationship between the structural and functional attributes (or pattern and process) of ecosystems with elephant, which by definition are key aspects of ecological heterogeneity (
     <italic>
      cf
     </italic>. 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Pickett1">
      [50]
     </xref>). Failing this, attempts to use water availability as a tool to maintain landscape heterogeneity in the presence of elephant may fail in its objectives.</p> 
    <p>Although piosphere patterns generally expand with increased herbivore numbers and/or decreased rainfall, systems with multiple water points may show overlapping impacts, which reduce the extent of impact at each point (e.g. 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-OwenSmith2">
      [7]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Graetz1">

     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Thrash2">
      [17]
     </xref>). During our 31-year study, we not only observed a decline in the thicket-dominated habitats adjacent to Hapoor, but also a significant decline in the displacement of asymptotes. Given that herbivory is the primary driver of thicket structure (as opposed to rainfall or fire, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Kerley4">
      [34]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-StuartHill2">
      [35]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Hayward2">
      [51]
     </xref>) and that the elephant population 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Kerley3">
      [31]
     </xref> and water provisioning increased exponentially over the experimental period, we speculate that this decline reflects the overlap of impacts from neighboring water points. Similarly, we presume that in the absence of a change in rainfall, the closing of an adjacent water point during the late-1970s (M. Landman Unpublished data) would have released utilization pressure at this time and increased shrub volume (from ∼35% at 100 m to ∼6% at 3000 m) during the 1981-survey. Importantly, the patterns of overlap varied for shrub volume and density, with the former showing a steady decline (but see above) over the experimental period (thus continued transformation), and the latter a stabilization post-1981. The stabilization in shrub density reflects the fact that the rootstocks of some species remain intact (thus, also maintaining the shape of the sigmoid curve) with intensive utilization, which suggests that these species might recover following a release in utilization pressure (e.g. 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Kerley4">
      [34]
     </xref>). The consequences of this for ecological functioning and ecosystem resilience are not clear. Although we had no information on elephant numbers at Hapoor water point for the study, it is likely that our piosphere effects co-varied with these changes; furthermore, these impacts will co-vary with rainfall and other confounding variables (e.g. fire) in more dynamic systems, using more dynamic ecological features. Thus, it will be critically important to include these variables and their interactions in models that describe piosphere patterns in order to develop a predictive understanding of the mechanisms that create and maintain these patterns. We further show that elephant piosphere effects vary both spatially and temporally between ecological features (i.e. community composition, shrub volumes and densities, shrub species). This suggests that a more integrated understanding of the effects of elephant on ecological heterogeneity may be required before water availability is used to manage elephant effects.</p> 
    <p>Piosphere effects are usually considered model systems that provide key insights into the effects of herbivores on ecosystems (e.g. 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-OwenSmith2">

     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045334-Adler1">
      [18]
     </xref>). Using multiple measures of biodiversity, we show that these effects are complex and that our ability to predict and manage such effects in the presence of elephant will be limited in the absence of long-term data. Instead we recommend an integrated multi-scaled approach to monitoring elephant effects in relation to water that incorporates both spatial and temporal variations and the structural and functional attributes of ecosystems. Furthermore, our findings clearly show the potentially adverse consequences of excessive water provisioning for succulent thicket communities
