     <abstract> 
      <p>Carbon stock change due to forest management and disturbance must be accounted for in UNFCCC national inventory reports and for signatories to the Kyoto Protocol. Impacts of disturbance on greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories are important for many countries with large forest estates prone to wildfires. Our objective was to measure changes in carbon stocks due to short-term combustion and to simulate longer-term carbon stock dynamics resulting from redistribution among biomass components following wildfire. We studied the impacts of a wildfire in 2009 that burnt temperate forest of tall, wet eucalypts in south-eastern Australia. Biomass combusted ranged from 40 to 58 tC ha<sup>−1</sup>, which represented 6–7% and 9–14% in low- and high-severity fire, respectively, of the pre-fire total biomass carbon stock. Pre-fire total stock ranged from 400 to 1040 tC ha<sup>−1</sup> depending on forest age and disturbance history. An estimated 3.9 TgC was emitted from the 2009 fire within the forest region, representing 8.5% of total biomass carbon stock across the landscape. Carbon losses from combustion were large over hours to days during the wildfire, but from an ecosystem dynamics perspective, the proportion of total carbon stock combusted was relatively small. Furthermore, more than half the stock losses from combustion were derived from biomass components with short lifetimes. Most biomass remained on-site, although redistributed from living to dead components. Decomposition of these components and new regeneration constituted the greatest changes in carbon stocks over ensuing decades. A critical issue for carbon accounting policy arises because the timeframes of ecological processes of carbon stock change are longer than the periods for reporting GHG inventories for national emissions reductions targets. Carbon accounts should be comprehensive of all stock changes, but reporting against targets should be based on human-induced changes in carbon stocks to incentivise mitigation activities.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title> 
    <p>Stabilising the carbon stock in the atmosphere to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system is the objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-United1">
      [1]
     </xref>. Forest ecosystems naturally exchange carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) with the atmosphere, but losses of carbon stocks from forests due to land management activities is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-Cubasch1">
      [2]
     </xref>. Losses of carbon as emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> from forest ecosystems to the atmosphere occur due to biological decomposition processes, natural disturbance events like fire, as well as human activities. Removals of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere to forest ecosystem carbon stocks occur by the uptake of carbon in growing vegetation.</p> 
    <p>Under the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, each country constructs GHG inventories and reports on their net annual emissions, that is, flows of CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHGs, due to specific activities and sectors including Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry. Flow-based inventories in the land sector, however, obscure important differences between ecosystems types and between the impacts of human activities and natural disturbances. A more comprehensive, stock-based approach to accounting can address these problems and provide information that complements flow-based accounts (Ajani et al. 2013). The flow-based accounts are currently used for national reporting against emission reduction targets over short time periods, such as annual or 5 to 8 year commitment periods, as determined by political negotiations. However, this short time period exposes nations to high variability in emissions due to natural disturbance events, especially wildfires, which are outside human control, yet create large GHG fluctuations. The resulting variability in national net emissions due to natural disturbance can be much greater than the changes due to land use impacts, thus confounding attempts to provide incentives for reducing emissions in the land sector through improved forest management.</p> 
    <p>Losses of carbon due to wildfire are a significant component of global annual GHG balances and so it is important that they are included in national inventories. Seasonal losses of carbon from wildfires are detected as high concentrations of trace gases in the troposphere

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-Gill1">
      [11]
     </xref>, the treatment of wildfires in carbon accounting for forest management is an important consideration. The rules and methodologies are complex, often controversial, and raise many issues in international accounting systems.</p> 
    <p>Carbon stock changes due to wildfires occur at different temporal scales that should be included in comprehensive stock-based accounts. Large losses occur over periods of hours to days or weeks due to combustion and are highly variable each year due to occurrence of fire. Uptake through forest regrowth and losses through decomposition of dead biomass occur over decades to centuries. These changes in carbon stocks are balanced in comprehensive accounts, and in the accumulated concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere, when assessed over a sufficiently long time period, assuming the fire regime is stationary. The following information is required to enable inclusion of wildfire disturbance in comprehensive stock-based national carbon accounts: carbon stock loss due to combustion, redistribution of carbon stocks between living and dead biomass components; subsequent rates of decomposition; and carbon uptake by regenerating vegetation. These estimates of carbon stock change need to be calculated on a landscape-wide basis and integrated over appropriate time periods 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-Hurst1">
      [12]
     </xref> with data from a range of forest types. However, methodologies for measuring carbon stock change due to wildfire are problematic for a number of reasons, including: (i) wildfires typically extend over large areas, within which fire severity varies spatially; (ii) initial carbon stocks vary across the landscape in response to differences in forest type, age, disturbance history and environmental factors; (iii) biomass components are combusted with differing efficiencies; (iv) fire occurrence is stochastic 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-vanderWerf2">
      [13]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-Gill2">
      [14]
     </xref>; and (v) the dynamics of carbon stocks occur over long time periods in response to wildfire.</p> 
    <p>Of these methodological issues, the parameter with the greatest uncertainty is the amount of carbon combusted, calculated as either an amount or a proportion of the fuel load or total stock, and then upscaled from individual components to sites and landscapes 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-Andreae1">
      [5]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-deGroot1">
      [15]
     </xref>. Combustion efficiency varies due to characteristics of individual fuel materials, such as logs of varying size, wood density, state of decay and moisture content 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-Hollis1">
      [16]
     </xref>, and characteristics of the fire, such as intensity and residence time, which determine the oxidation conditions of flaming or smouldering combustion

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-Scholes2">
      [18]
     </xref>. At the landscape scale, the proportion combusted depends on the areas burnt within the fire boundary, including small scale heterogeneity in fire occurrence and severity. The high degree of uncertainty created by the limited existing data is demonstrated when aggregated spatially in regional and global inventories. For example, estimates of carbon stock losses from wildfires in Australia derived from global analyses differ by up to six-fold

    <p>To address these issues about accounting for carbon stock changes due to wildfire, we examined changes in carbon stocks in a temperate eucalypt forest in south-east Australia that was subjected to a wildfire in 2009. We selected a temperate forest because they contain high carbon stocks and contribute 34% to the global forest carbon sink; a proportion that has been increasing over the last two decades

The site categories of forest age were 1983 and 1939 regrowth after wildfire followed by salvage logging or clearcut logging, and old growth. Salvage logging was common practice after wildfire to remove the timber resource

     <p>While the 54 sites covered a range of forest stand structures and disturbance histories, the assumption that the sites had comparable pre-fire biomass carbon stocks, disturbance history, and local biophysical conditions did not necessarily hold.

     <title>Measurement of biomass carbon stocks and stock loss due to fire</title> 
     <p>We measured carbon stocks in all aboveground biomass components in the forest (living vegetation, dead standing trees, coarse woody debris (CWD or dead and downed woody debris), and litter) at the selected 54 sites in 2010. We defined biomass as all intact organic components of the ecosystem, both living and dead, above- and below-ground, but excluding soil organic matter. Biomass components were classified for ease of measurement and to track movement of carbon between ecosystem components. Classification was based on the status of living or dead, size and vertical location. We used different sampling strategies for each biomass component within 1 ha sites to maximise accuracy and efficiency of measurements of different sizes, densities and distributions of components (

Each piece of CWD was assessed for hollows and degree of decay in three categories. Bulk density was measured for each category of decay to determine biomass. The litter layer consisted of organic material less than 25 mm diameter including leaves, twigs, insect detritus, animal scats, and comminuted material that was recognisable as organic material. Litter depth was measured at 15 points per site on a compressed litter pack to standardise the quantity of loose material. Depth was converted to biomass using a relationship derived from 30 quadrats sampled for dry weight of litter.

A range of species and sizes of understorey shrubs was sampled.</p> 
     <p>Combustion of CWD was determined on each piece along the measurement transects by the proportion of the piece charred, or by the number of lines of charcoal remaining on the ground. The initial carbon stock of the logs that were completely converted to charcoal was assumed to be represented by the mean size of logs at the site. CWD was too variable between burnt and unburnt sites within stand age categories to allow a comparison to be indicative of the amount combusted as the mean of a category. The proportion of the litter layer combusted was estimated from photographs of quadrats taken soon after the fire in low- and high-severity burnt areas and compared with litter biomass in unburnt sites.</p>

Initial conditions for the model used site data of the current carbon stock in each age category and the proportion of the stock combusted. After the fire, carbon stocks were redistributed among living and dead components according to the proportions measured in each age category. For the second fire cycle, the initial condition of total biomass at the time of the fire was the stock simulated for year 112, and the proportions of the stock combusted and redistributed were taken as the average of the site data from the 1939 regrowth and old growth forests. Changes in carbon stocks over time were simulated using functions to describe the processes of regeneration, mortality, collapse of dead trees, and decomposition of CWD derived from existing data and observations for montane ash forest (

     <p>Biomass density varied substantially among sites within the montane ash forest due to the disturbance history and subsequent age distribution of the forest. Biomass density (mean ±standard error, n = 6 sites) in unburnt stands was 405±33 tC ha<sup>−1</sup> in 1983 regrowth, 603±74 tC ha<sup>−1</sup> in 1939 regrowth, and 1039±44 tC ha<sup>−1</sup> in old growth sites. The structure of these forest stands is illustrated in terms of the distribution of their carbon stock by tree sizes (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107126-g005">
       Figure 5
      </xref>). These tree sizes demonstrate that the regrowth stands were not necessarily even-aged and included some larger residual trees which contained high, but variable, levels of biomass.</p>

     <p>CWD biomass was highly variable among sites in the age/fire categories, ranging from 15 to 186 tC ha<sup>−1</sup>, with a mean of 67 tC ha<sup>−1</sup>. There was no significant difference in CWD biomass between forest age categories, reflecting the varied disturbance history of these forests where CWD remained after logging and wildfire, and its biomass was not related to the age of the stands. Litter biomass in the unburnt sites ranged from 6 tC ha<sup>−1</sup> in the 1983 regrowth to 9 tC ha<sup>−1</sup> in mature and old growth stands. This litter biomass corresponded to average site depth of litter when compressed of 2 cm and 3 cm, respectively, with the majority of measured points less than 5 cm and only a few points with 5–10 cm depth.</p>

     <title>Biomass components combusted</title> 
     <p>In areas burnt by low-severity fire, most of the over-storey trees survived as well as variable proportions of mid- and under-storey vegetation with green, scorched or combusted leaves. In areas burnt by high-severity fire, most of the leaves, twigs and decorticating bark in all canopy strata were combusted, although scorched leaves remained in patches. Some montane ash forests included a few 
      <italic>
       E. nitens
      </italic> trees that regenerated by epicormic growth. Woody stems of most shrubs and mid-storey trees remained, but some were entirely combusted. The average branch size combusted from shrubs was 4 mm (maximum 19 mm) in low-severity fire, and 8 mm (maximum 42 mm) in high-severity fire.</p> 
     <p>The carbon stock losses from each biomass component and the proportion of the total biomass combusted differed with age class of the forest (
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107126-t004">
       Table 4
      </xref>). The distribution of readily combusted components within the ecosystem influenced the proportion of the stock emitted during the fire. Much of the observed change due to fire was combustion of shrubs in the understorey. However, this represented a small proportion of the total biomass in the ecosystem. Combustion of 7.8–16.2 tC ha<sup>−1</sup> in the small branches on shrubs of all stem diameter categories in the understorey (
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107126-t004">

     <p>Some CWD was combusted during the fire, but both the absolute amount and proportion of initial biomass were highly variable spatially. Higher amounts of CWD were combusted in the 1983 and 1939 regrowth stands (range 1.37–2.41 tC ha<sup>−1</sup>) than in the old growth stands (0.16–0.43 tC ha<sup>−1</sup>) (
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107126-t004">
       Table 4
      </xref>). Large amounts of CWD occur in these regrowth stands due to self-thinning and residual material from previous logging and fire events. The high rates of combustion in regrowth stands occur because large proportions of the CWD are small logs and drier logs (decay class 1), compared with the old growth stands. Hollow or damaged trees, either living or dead, were a major source of carbon stock loss (3.8–21.7 tC ha<sup>−1</sup>) (
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107126-t004">
       Table 4

In regrowth stands, hollow trees comprised 2–12% of the total tree biomass, and contained a carbon stock ranging from 7–50 tC ha<sup>−1</sup>. In old-growth stands, trees with hollows generally consisted of the older cohort of trees but also included damaged younger trees. They represented a highly variable proportion of the total biomass, from 9–49%, and contained a carbon stock of 45–241 tC ha<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

     <title>Carbon stock dynamics</title> 
     <p>Combustion of biomass during the fire resulted in an initial loss of some carbon, but most of the biomass remained at the site. Our simulation model predicted that carbon stocks would increase for several decades after the fire due to the combination of regeneration of living biomass and persistence of dead biomass components (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107126-g007">
       Figure 7
      </xref>). Mortality of trees during the fire produced large amounts of dead biomass, but the trees only collapsed slowly and then contributed to the CWD pool, from where carbon stock loss by decomposition occurred over many decades. The lowest carbon stock in an old growth forest occurred nearly a century after a single fire when most of the dead biomass produced by the fire had decomposed. The maximum fluctuation in carbon stock over time as a result of fire was estimated to be 20% from the scenario of a single high-severity fire in old growth forest where there was no trend in total biomass due to changes in forest age (

     <p>The carbon stock dynamics in the forests of initially different ages reflect the differences in the total biomass stock, its distribution among living and dead trees and CWD, the proportion combusted, and the proportions remaining in each of the components after the fire. The old growth forest had the largest increase in total biomass with the combined regeneration plus remaining dead trees, but subsequently the largest decline in total biomass as the dead trees collapsed and decomposed (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107126-g007">
       Figure 7b

     <p>Under a regime of repeated fires on a 112-year return time, trends occurred in the total biomass carbon stock because forest age changed from that of the initial forest. The old growth forest decreased in carbon stock because of the more frequent disturbance, whereas the 1983 and 1939 regrowth forests increased in carbon stock because they remained undisturbed for a longer period than at their initial age. These scenarios of carbon stock dynamics represent an average forest stand of a given initial age subject to the average wildfire regime. A range of forest age classes occur across the landscape, including forests much older than 112 years. Forests that remain undisturbed for several hundred years have the capacity to continue accumulating carbon stocks.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title> 
    <p>Although the total amount of carbon stock loss across the landscape burnt during the wildfire was large as an annual flow in the national inventory, we found that the proportion of total ecosystem carbon stock combusted was relatively small, both at site and landscape scales. The major impact of wildfire was the redistribution of carbon among biomass components, from living to dead biomass and CWD, and their longer-term rates of change due to decomposition and regeneration. Assessing the carbon stock loss by combustion in relation to the total stock, rather than fuel load, meant that changes in stock could be tracked over time and compared between different human activities and disturbance types.</p> 
    <sec id="s4a"> 
     <title>Amount and proportion of forest ecosystem carbon stock combusted</title> 
     <p>We found that the proportion of total ecosystem biomass carbon stock combusted during a wildfire in the montane ash forest was 6–14% at the site scale depending on fire severity and forest age (27 years to old growth), with an average of 8.5% across the landscape that was burnt. This is a relatively small proportion compared with impacts of human disturbance events, such as logging that removes biomass off-site

Our results are similar to studies in other forest ecosystems (boreal, temperate mixed conifer, savannah woodlands, and other temperate wet sclerophyll) that estimated the relationship between carbon stock loss with total stock, but are lower than estimates of proportion of biomass combusted related to fine and coarse fuel loads (data and references in

     <p>The estimated loss of only a small proportion of ecosystem carbon stock combusted in a fire concords with simulation results of net losses of carbon by 4 to 8% over 180 years under a fire regime scenario of increased frequency and intensity in south-east Australia 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-King1">
       [85]
      </xref>. Under this scenario, the loss was due to increased mortality leading to a younger age distribution of trees. Similarly, a sensitivity analysis of the carbon balance model for Canadian forests showed that a three-fold increase in area burned decreased the total forest carbon stock by 6% over 100 years 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-Kurz2">
       [86]
      </xref>. These predicted losses of carbon stocks are relatively small over a century or two compared with the impact of many human activities.</p> 
     <p>Differences in the proportion of fine fuel combusted in different ecosystems are insignificant in terms of the total ecosystem carbon stock, representing 0.5 to 1% or 0.5 to 3 tC ha<sup>−1</sup>. The proportion of coarse fuel combusted varies greatly depending on the size of material, which is influenced not only by forest age but also by disturbance history. Although proportions of biomass combusted were lower in montane ash forest than in other forest types, the amounts combusted in these fuel size classes were greater (
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107126.s001">

     <p>We conclude from our methodology that estimating carbon stock loss as a proportion of the total ecosystem carbon stock (based on tracking each biomass component) is a useful metric to compare with other impacts on ecosystem carbon stocks and other sectors of the national GHG inventory. This metric is thus more appropriate for national accounts than the current default reporting of emissions as the product of a combustion factor and fuel load in the IPCC guidelines and Australian national inventory report

     <title>Changes in forest biomass carbon dynamics</title> 
     <p>The major impact of wildfire in the montane ash forest was the redistribution of carbon among biomass components, from living to dead, and subsequent long-term stock losses from decomposition and gains by regeneration. The relative rates of these processes and subsequent mean residence times of the biomass components determine the long-term dynamics of carbon stock in the ecosystem. These long-term dynamics resulted in changes of up to 20% about the mean stock, whereas direct losses from combustion represented 6–14% of the total biomass stock.</p> 
     <p>Mean residence time of the biomass components combusted is critical for determining the impact of wildfire on longer-term carbon dynamics. More than half the stock losses from combustion were derived from biomass components with short lifetimes; in the canopy, bark, litter layer and shrubs.

An average NEE over 10 years of measurements was 5.8 tC ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> and the maximum was 9.3 tC ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> in an 80 year old stand of

      </italic> provision of minimising annual variability in the reported net stock changes due to natural disturbance events. The rationale is that this variability should not negate reductions in emissions due to human mitigation activities over the timeframe of the reporting

     <p>Our results about the magnitude and timeframes of carbon stock changes due to wildfires suggest that carbon accounts need to be comprehensive and include all stocks and flows. Such accounts enable differentiation of stock changes due to natural disturbances and human activities. There are four reasons why constructing carbon accounts which differentiate carbon stock changes are beneficial.</p> 
     <p>First, our results show that in terms of national annual net change in carbon stocks, the magnitude of carbon stock loss due to combustion in a wildfire is sufficient to mask reduced emissions due to mitigation activities. Our estimated carbon stock loss was 3.9 TgC from a single (albeit large) fire in 2009 within the montane ash forest. The annual average for all fires in Australia is estimated to be 8.7 TgC yr<sup>−1</sup> 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-Australian1">
       [100]
      </xref>. These single and average wildfire emissions represent about 27% and 59%, respectively, of Australia’s annual emissions reduction target of 14.7 TgC yr<sup>−1</sup> 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-Australian1">
       [100]
      </xref>. Similar magnitudes of emissions from individual wildfires have been quantified elsewhere, for example 2.9 TgC from the 2003 Californian fires 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-Mhle1">
       [101]
      </xref>. Hence, differentiation of carbon stock changes due to natural disturbances and human activities is important when national GHG inventory reports are used for assessing progress in meeting emission reduction targets over short time periods.</p> 
     <p>Second, we demonstrated that the changes in carbon stocks in response to a disturbance event occur over the following decades. Hence, derivation of a background level of net carbon stocks over a two decade period (1990–2009) is not adequate to account for the variations in carbon dynamics within a disturbed area. However, the carbon stock at the landscape scale represents the sum of forest stands that have been burnt at different times and intensities, thus producing a mosaic of stand age classes, amounts of debris, and stages of recovery from disturbance. Under a stable disturbance regime, the carbon stock at the landscape scale remains stable when accounted for over sufficiently long time periods. Hence, carbon stock losses from combustion of biomass components do not increase the accumulated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under a stable fire regime. Carbon stock dynamics may alter at the landscape level if fire regimes change due to climate change, or due to the effects of growth from a forest age class distribution affected by historical activities

       [104]
      </xref>.</p> 
     <p>Third, the increases and decreases in carbon stock post-fire resulting from differential rates of regeneration, mortality and decomposition mean that excluding burnt areas from the national inventory until carbon stocks are restored to pre-fire levels, is not an adequate method for excluding the effect of natural disturbances on net changes in carbon stocks. In fact, the increase in carbon stocks for some decades post-fire would produce artificial credits, but later decreases due to decomposition would produce artificial debits in the national inventory, which are not related to human activities. Additionally, the high levels of uncertainty in these long-term dynamics could produce errors in the national inventory.</p> 
     <p>Fourth, an averaging period of net stock changes from a disturbance regime over two decades, or within the time period of adequate records, does not encompass the temporal scale of natural variability in wildfire regimes in many temperate forest ecosystems 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107126-Macintosh1">

This provided a more representative range in carbon stock losses at the regional scale. Covering this range is important even though a balanced experimental design is difficult to obtain in studies of stochastic disturbance events where field sites may not be comparable because of uncertainties in disturbance histories and stand ages. Previous studies in Australia have used either experimental fires imposed on a planned design of sites and pre-fire measurements, where the fires were either lower severity than wildfire or regeneration burns of logging slash

     <p>The results of up-scaling the site data to estimate carbon stocks and stock losses across our study region revealed that the effect of disturbance history on tree age structure and CWD was the major source of uncertainty in spatial estimates of biomass carbon stocks. Other studies have drawn similar conclusions that the determination of forest stand age is the main factor contributing to uncertainty in assessment of regional carbon stocks

     <p>Our results suggest that current national accounting that uses default values (Tier 2 methodology) for fuel combustion efficiency and fuel load can be improved by using site data from different ecosystems. Data from existing state forest inventories need to be augmented by comprehensive sampling of forest age structure, including old growth forests, and all components of the carbon stock, including dead wood. The methods used here are generic and would constitute Tier 3 methodology that is appropriate for national and project-based accounting. The sampling methods were non-destructive and feasible to apply to a large number of sites.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title> 
    <p>Carbon stocks in forest ecosystems change in response to wildfire in the short-term by combustion and in the long-term by redistribution among biomass components and their subsequent differential rates of decomposition and regeneration. It is important that carbon accounts include these processes because all stock changes, activities and land areas contribute to quantifying the global carbon cycle. However, the timeframes of the ecological processes that determine carbon stock changes are longer than the time periods for reporting of national inventories for compliance with emissions reductions targets. This problem of incongruous timeframes means that reporting against targets should be based on net changes in carbon stocks from human activities to incentivise mitigation activities. If the carbon accounts differentiate stock changes between the sources from natural and human-induced disturbances, then the net stock change from human activities can be extracted from the accounts for use in reporting. This distinction is currently made between the comprehensive UNFCCC accounts and the reports against targets for the Kyoto Protocol, except that the guidelines for the Protocol include net stock changes from natural disturbances that can be discounted above an averaged background level. However, our results indicate that the spatial and temporal variability in carbon dynamics is too high and the uncertainty of estimates too great to enable a realistic averaged background level that would prevent distortions of the inventory by stock changes that were outside human control.</p>
