     <abstract> 
      <p>The concept of ecosystem services – the benefits that nature provides to human's society – has gained increasing attention over the past decade. Increasing global abiotic and biotic change, including species invasions, is threatening the secure delivery of these ecosystem services. Efficient evaluation methods of ecosystem services are urgently needed to improve our ability to determine management strategies and restoration goals in face of these new emerging ecosystems. Considering a range of multiple ecosystem functions may be a useful way to determine such strategies. We tested this framework experimentally in California grasslands, where large shifts in species composition have occurred since the late 1700's. We compared a suite of ecosystem functions within one historic native and two non-native species assemblages under different grazing intensities to address how different species assemblages vary in provisioning, regulatory and supporting ecosystem services. Forage production was reduced in one non-native assemblage (medusahead). Cultural ecosystem services, such as native species diversity, were inherently lower in both non-native assemblages, whereas most other services were maintained across grazing intensities. All systems provided similar ecosystem services under the highest grazing intensity treatment, which simulated unsustainable grazing intensity. We suggest that applying a more comprehensive ecosystem framework that considers multiple ecosystem services to evaluate new emerging ecosystems is a valuable tool to determine management goals and how to intervene in a changing ecosystem.</p>

    <p>The ecosystem service framework has arisen as one promising avenue to evaluate effects of changed species assemblages

      [7]
     </xref>. Species interact with their environment to affect a range of ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling and biomass production. When these ecosystem functions affect human wellbeing, they are considered ecosystem services 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Millennium1">
      [8]
     </xref>. The ecosystem service framework highlights the breadth of ways in which species can affect human wellbeing, from enhancing culture and providing food to regulating climate conditions. Moreover, it highlights that different ecosystems may provide some, if not all, of the same functions. Thus, the ecosystem service framework can holistically characterize how species affect the environment and provides a way to prioritize landscape management.</p> 
    <p>The melding of ecosystem services and changed species composition may be nowhere stronger than in California grasslands. While historic records are sparse, California grasslands are thought to have consisted of a range of numerous cool-season perennial grasses, including 
     <italic>
      Stipa pulchra
     </italic> Hitchc. (purple needle grass) and 
     <italic>
      Elymus glaucus

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Hamilton1">
      [9]
     </xref>. After European settlement, non-native annual Mediterranean grasses, such as 
     <italic>
      Avena fatua
     </italic> L. (wild oats) and 
     <italic>
      Bromus hordeaceus
     </italic> L. (soft brome), replaced much of the native grassland. Now covering half of the state, these non-native grasslands provide one of the most important ecosystem services in California, forage for cattle, sustaining a 1.3 billion dollar industry

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Huntsinger1">
      [11]
     </xref>.</p> 
    <p>More recently, a second wave of Mediterranean species, such as 
     <italic>
      Taeniatherum caput-medusae
     </italic> L. (Medusahead) and 
     <italic>
      Centaurea solistitialis
     </italic> L. (yellow starthistle), is jeopardizing grassland forage potential due to the low palatability of these species 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-DiTomaso1">
      [12]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Eagle1">
      [13]
     </xref>. Because of the risks these species pose to the cattle industry, much attention is directed at forage impacts, but our understanding about how changing species assemblages will affect other ecosystem functions or native species conservation is limited.</p> 
    <p>Thus, California's rangelands are an intriguing model system for challenging questions in invaded landscapes across the globe: How much do different species assemblages vary in their ability to provide forage, as well as other less-monitorized regulatory and supporting services? How do we balance the cultural needs of protecting native species with other ecosystem services? We answer these questions using an experimental approach in which we established replicate plots of native perennial grasses, and two non-native annual grass species assemblages in a common environment. In contrast to observational studies, this approach allowed us to isolate species-specific effects on ecosystem functions by holding abiotic factors, such as soil type and precipitation amount, constant across species assemblages. We implemented a grazing gradient across these assemblages to evaluate which functions will be maintained under increasing grazing intensity. After allowing these treatments time to establish, we measured multiple functions related to a range of ecosystem services outlined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Millennium1">
      [8]
     </xref>. These included forage potential, the primary provisioning service provided by California grasslands, and native cover and diversity, which are important cultural services for many Californians

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Silver1">
      [15]

     <p>The experiment was located in valley grassland at the University of California Sierra Foothill Research Extension Center (SFREC), Browns Valley, California, USA (39° 15' N, 121° 17' W). The site is characterized by a Mediterranean climate with cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Annual rainfall is 700 m, most (&gt;92%) of which falls during the growing season from October through April 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-California1">
       [16]

       [17]
      </xref>. The study areas had been grazed by cattle for 150 years prior to our experiment, but we fenced them to facilitate our grazing manipulations over the course of the study.</p> 
     <p>Like other valley grasslands throughout California, our study sites comprise three primary vegetation types which are characterized by their dominant species: native perennial bunchgrasses (

      </italic> L.; hereafter ‘non-native weed’). It is common for these species assemblages to occur separately, both as patches and at the landscape scale. Native dominance is actively maintained through management in some areas, whereas forage grasses tend to dominate elsewhere and invasion by medusahead often result in the formation of monotypic stands. As areas infested by medusahead are avoided by livestock as soon as flowerheads appear 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Young1">

     <title>Creation of different species assemblages along a grazing gradient</title> 
     <p>In accordance with the naturally dominating vegetation types in our study area, we created three different species assemblages of the aforementioned vegetation types: native perennial bunchgrasses, non-native forage grasses, and the non-native weed (medusahead). We established these assemblages with a mixture of planting perennial plugs, seeding annual species, and weeding in 2007, in 40 m×10 m plots within four replicate blocks, split across two pastures, for a total of 12 species assemblage plots (see 
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0075396.s001">
       Figure S1
      </xref> for details on the experimental design and set up).</p> 
     <p>Following the establishment of the species assemblages for two seasons, we split the species assemblage plots in six split-plot treatments representing different levels of grazing intensity in May 2008. The grazing intensity manipulation was achieved with a combination of trampling by cattle and mechanical mowing to establish a grazing gradient with six different grazing levels, ranging from non-grazed to highly grazed, the latter representing unsustainable over-grazing 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Bartolome1">
       [21]
      </xref> (see 
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0075396.s001">
       Figure S1
      </xref> for details on the grazing treatments). Thus, the different grazing intensities presented here refer to both trampling and mowing effects. We replicated each grazing treatment twice in each of the four main blocks, resulting in eight 9 m×3 m replicate plots of each treatment combination. Because it was unfeasible to manipulate cattle within a 9 m×3 m plot, we implemented the grazing treatment in an ordered, mirror design (none to high, high to none) that extended across all three species assemblage types (
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0075396.s001">
       Figure S1
      </xref>). This design is similar to line-source experiments commonly used in agricultural studies 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Fernandez1">
       [22]
      </xref>, best satisfying the joint constraints of large-scale grazing manipulations and species plantings.

     <p>To measure forage production we harvested total aboveground biomass (peak standing biomass plus the biomass removed by each respective mowing treatment) from a randomly-positioned 0.25 m×0.25 m subplot, dried (60°C for 72 h) and weighed it. We corrected this value by the proportion of non-palatable species (see 
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075396-t001">
       Table 1
      </xref>) in the respective plot. To quantify cultural services we calculated the percent cover of native species and species diversity (Shannon Evenness), including both species that were original planted and those that had naturally established in each plot. We defined invasibility as the number of naturally establishing plant species.</p> 
     <p>We used two measures of soil carbon sequestration: fine root production and potential soil respiration rates. We measured fine root production using the root ingrowth technique. In December 2009, we filled fiberglass mesh bags (mesh size 1.5 mm, 4 cm diameter, 20 cm height) with root-free sieved soil and vertically buried them 20 cm deep in the rooting zone for 15 weeks. We homogenized the soil in each core and picked roots from the soil cores by hand over a standardized time period. Subsequently, we cleaned the roots of residual soil and detritus, dried them at 60°C to constant mass and weighed them. In February 2010, we measured potential soil respiration rates from freshly collected soil samples (we pooled three subsamples per grazing × species assemblage plot, each 2 cm diameter, 10 cm depth). We placed 2 g of air dried root-free soil into glass vials and added DI water to reach 25% soil moisture. We incubated two replicates from the pooled subsamples for each of the treatment plots and allowed each to reach ambient temperature of approximately 20°C; we opened the vials just prior to the incubation so that headspaces would equilibrate with ambient air. Then we sealed the vials, maintained them in the laboratory at 20°C, and collected 10 mL of headspace after two hours. We immediately injected each gas sample into an EGM-4 Infrared Gas Analyzer.</p> 
     <p>To characterize nutrient retention, we measured potential decomposition rates and nitrogen availability. We measured potential decomposition rates via litterbags (nylon screen, 2 mm mesh size, 10 cm×17 cm) filled with three pieces of filterpaper (Whatman No. 1, 11 mm diameter) that we placed directly on the soil surface on Dec.13<sup>th</sup>, 2009 and removed on March 30th, 2010. We cleaned the filterpaper of residual soil and detritus, dried it at 60°C to constant mass and weighed it. We quantified soil nitrogen availability using three ion exchange resin bags (Sigma Aldrich Dowex Marathon MR-3 hydrogen and hydroxide form 13687-U mixed beads wrapped in Nylon/Lycra swimsuit liner material) placed in the center of each plot at a depth of 10 cm. We placed the resin bags in the ground from December 16<sup>th</sup>, 2009 to March, 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2010 and extracted them with 2 mol/L KCL. We measured inorganic-N availability (ammonium and nitrate) with a SmartChem autoanalyzer.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title> 
    <p>Using California grassland ecosystems as a model system, our study demonstrates changed species assemblages may alter some ecosystem functions while maintaining others. Ecosystem services tied to key species, such as cultural appreciation of native species, were inherently lower in both non-native dominated systems, whereas regulatory and supporting services, such as carbon storage and nutrient cycling, were similar regardless of the dominant type of grass species (
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075396-g002">
      Figure 2
     </xref>). Provisioning services such as forage potential, which are of major interest in these grassland systems, were maintained in one non-native system but not in another. High grazing intensity caused all ecosystems to become similar in the provisioning of ecosystem services (
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075396-g002">
      Figure 2
     </xref>).</p> 
    <p>As species assemblages shift and adapt to environmental change or land use, there may be instances in which managing for the provisioning of certain ecosystem services provides a valuable management framework 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Mascaro1">
      [25]
     </xref>. For example, the functional convergence between the native and non-native assemblages under high grazing was related to a grazing-induced species convergence: across ecosystems, grazing led to an increase in annual forbs (e.g. 
     <italic>
      Erodium
     </italic> spp., 
     <italic>
      Trifolium
     </italic> spp.). However, the native perennial grasses were more sensitive to grazing than annual grasses and may be less likely to persist under high grazing intensities. Along another axis, forage production actually increased with grazing in the non-native weed (medusahead) dominated grasslands due to the replacement of medusahead with more palatable annual forb species. Thus, our result highlights the importance of tailoring management actions to specific ecosystem types, as the same strategy might cause opposite effects within different ecosystems.</p> 
    <p>It is a tautology that cultural services tied to native species are necessarily low in non-native ecosystems. Therefore it is of immense importance to clearly set management priorities. If native species conservation is the primary goal, management decisions need to be shaped around that goal. However, alone the ongoing debate about the effects of grazing management on native species conservation shows that results are often controversial 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Germano1">
      [26]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Kimball1">
      [27]
     </xref>.</p> 
    <p>Evaluating ecosystems based on specific services requires determining priorities and understanding that trade-offs may be inevitable. For example, clear differences existed among our three species assemblages with respect to native species conservation and forage production. While these services are often the main goals in rangeland management, regulatory services such as carbon sequestration are gaining prominence in how managers evaluate systems, and supporting services such as nutrient retention play key roles in maintaining many valued services. How desirable ecosystem services will be evaluated is context dependent making generalizations difficult 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Srivastava1">
      [28]
     </xref>. For instance, lower carbon mineralization and nutrient cycling rates might be desirable in our study system as they reduce potential carbon and nitrogen loss rates.</p> 
    <p>We suggest that applying a more comprehensive ecosystem framework to evaluate new emerging ecosystems is a valuable tool to inform management goals across species assemblages and to decide if or how to intervene in a changing ecosystem

Replicates of species assemblages were set up in two blocks per pasture and their location was randomized within blocks. Both pastures were fenced to exclude large herbivores. Soil solarization, a common method in agriculture for controlling soil-borne pathogens and weeds 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Katan1">
       [31]
      </xref>, was applied as a pre-planting soil treatment. We tilled the soil, and then covered the soil with black Polyethylene plastic tarps for 14 days, trapping solar heat to reduce seed bank 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-EPA1">
       [32]
      </xref>. The native grasses were planted at a density of 12.5 plugs m<sup>−2</sup> with equal numbers for the three species (total 20,000 plugs, plug diameter 2.5–6 cm, Hedgerow Farms, Winters, California, USA). The annual forage grasses were seeded at equal rates with a total rate of 23–28 g seeds per species m<sup>−2</sup> (Pacific Coast Seed, Livermore, California, USA) and 
      <italic>
       T. caput-medusae
      </italic> was seeded at a rate of 21 g seeds m<sup>−2</sup> (seeds collected at the research center). Plots were watered and broadleaf herbicides were applied only during the first growing season to ensure successful and even establishment of the species assemblages. We did not manipulate species composition or resource availability in subsequent years. We initiated the grazing treatments after 1.5 years to allow establishment of the vegetation. We split each of the four vegetation blocks in half, and in each half, applied a gradient of grazing treatments laid out perpendicular to the species assemblage treatments in 3×30 m strips with an additional 2 m buffer zone on each side of the species assemblages blocks. For this study we used the following three of the six grazing intensity levels: 1) control that was not trampled or mowed (“non-grazed”); 2) medium grazed, which was trampled twice per year (in late March when plants started flowering and in June/July after most plants were senescent) with one mowing treatment right before the late March trampling treatment; and 3) high grazed, which was trampled twice a year as treatment two with mowing prior to each trampling and an additional mowing in late February during early plant growth. The mowing treatment included cutting the vegetation at a height of 2 cm above ground with a mechanical “walk-behind” mower and removing the biomass. For each trampling treatment 40–42 cattle (up to one year old, Black Angus Mix, 900–1000lbs/cattle) were herded onto the respective strips for 30–45 minutes depending on soil conditions. Under moist soil conditions, trampling times were shortened to achieve comparable trampling effects compared to dry soil conditions. In order to have areas large enough for cattle, trampling treatments encompassed all species assemblages simultaneously as well as same grazing intensity levels (one fenced area); cattle were not allowed to graze to avoid uncontrolled biomass removal. Thus, the experimental design was a split plot arrangement in which the subplot levels (grazing intensity) represent a non-randomized division of the species assemblages (whole plots). Each plot representing a specific species assemblage × grazing intensity combination was 3 m×10 m in size. We acknowledge several levels of dependence within our design: within pasture, within grazing gradient, and spatially proximity of adjacent levels of grazing treatment. However, we feel that this design, which derived from line-source experiments often used in agricultural studies 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Fernandez1">
       [22]
      </xref>, best enabled the joint constraints of larger scale grazing treatments with logistical planting restrictions in our experimental manipulations. Using a ‘Toeplitz’ (3-banded) variance/covariance matrix enables us to account for the spatial dependency of the sample units 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075396-Littell1">
       [24]
      </xref>, i.e. we can fit variance models to structures at the residual (R) and the random (G) level.</p>
