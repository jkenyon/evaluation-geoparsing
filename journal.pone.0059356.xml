     <abstract> 
      <p>Globally, most restoration efforts focus on re-creating the physical structure (flora or physical features) of a target ecosystem with the assumption that other ecosystem components will follow. Here we investigate that assumption by documenting biogeographical patterns in an important invertebrate taxon, the parasitoid wasp family Ichneumonidae, in a recently reforested Hawaiian landscape. Specifically, we test the influence of (1) planting configurations (corridors versus patches), (2) vegetation age, (3) distance from mature native forest, (4) surrounding tree cover, and (5) plant community composition on ichneumonid richness, abundance, and composition. We sampled over 7,000 wasps, 96.5% of which were not native to Hawai’i. We found greater relative richness and abundance of ichneumonids, and substantially different communities, in restored areas compared to mature forest and abandoned pasturelands. Non-native ichneumonids drive these differences; restored areas and native forest did not differ in native ichneumonid abundance. Among restored areas, ichneumonid communities did not differ by planting age or configuration. As tree cover increased within 120 m of a sampling point, ichneumonid community composition increasingly resembled that found in native forest. Similarly, native ichneumonid abundance increased with proximity to native forest. Our results suggest that restoration plantings, if situated near target forest ecosystems and in areas with higher local tree cover, can facilitate restoration of native fauna even in a highly invaded system.</p>

    <p>Ecological restoration efforts to conserve both biodiversity and ecosystem services are increasingly common 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-ReyBenayas1">
      [1]
     </xref>. The success of restoration remains poorly known, however, because of tendencies to monitor only a few ecosystem components 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Young1">
      [2]
     </xref> and for only a few years after restoration activity 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Goldstein1">
      [3]
     </xref>. The majority of projects are evaluated on progress towards restoring physical structure (flora or physical features) or vertebrate species of concern, while rarely measuring effects on other taxa or ecosystem processes 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Stewart1">
      [4]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Hilderbrand1">
      [5]
     </xref>. Among more systematically monitored projects, many fail to achieve the targeted ecosystem’s species composition, structure, or function 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Zedler1">
      [6]

    <p>Arthropods play important roles in ecosystems as pollinators, predators, parasites, and prey 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Williams1">
      [8]
     </xref>. Their small size, short life cycles, and large numbers facilitate use as indicators of overall biodiversity and ecosystem stability 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Longcore1">
      [9]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Maleque1">
      [10]
     </xref>. The use of arthropods to monitor restoration progress, however, also has a notable disadvantage: the scarcity of life history and ecological data on most arthropod species make some ecological analyses difficult 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Longcore1">
      [9]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Majer1">
      [11]
     </xref>. Among studies of arthropod response to restoration of native plants, some report successful arthropod community restoration compared to the reference ecosystem in the long term (30 years) 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Majer1">
      [11]
     </xref>, and even in the short term (&lt;6 years 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Williams1">
      [8]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Jansen1">
      [12]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Burger1">
      [13]
     </xref>). The definition of “success” varies 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Allison1">
      [14]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Choi1">
      [15]
     </xref>. One of these studies, for example, found common arthropods in similar densities on planted and naturally occurring shrubs in California scrubland, but that planted shrubs were less likely to support rare species 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Burger1">
      [13]
     </xref>. Other studies have found markedly dissimilar communities between restored and reference sites in both the short and long term

      [9]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Majer1">
      [11]
     </xref>, 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Parmenter1">
      [16]
     </xref>; one documented greater butterfly richness and abundance in restored areas than in control areas 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Waltz1">
      [17]
     </xref>.</p> 
    <p>Driven by mixed results from past analyses of arthropods in restoration, we explore the effect of efforts to restore pasturelands to montane Hawaiian forest on the parasitoid wasp family Ichneumonidae. This family, with ca. 60,000 species 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Goulet1">
      [18]
     </xref>, is one of the most biologically diverse insect families in the world. We chose to focus on ichneumonids for a number of reasons. First, the native Hawaiian ichneumonid fauna includes at least three subfamilies and 38 species 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Peck1">
      [19]
     </xref>. Second, Ichneumonids are relatively host-specific parasitoids whose diversity is thought to reflect that of their hosts 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Shaw1">
      [20]
     </xref> and sometimes other arthropod groups 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Anderson1">
      [21]
     </xref>; relatedly, their complex trophic roles can lead to substantial impacts on other species when icheumonids are introduced into new ecosystems 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Snyder1">
      [22]
     </xref>. Third, they appear to disperse readily to suitable habitat 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Nouhuys1">
      [23]
     </xref> and to indicate environmental change 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Shaw2">
      [24]
     </xref>.</p> 
    <p>Another important reason for selecting this taxon is that many native and non-native ichneumonids in Hawai’i parasitize Lepidoptera 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Peck1">
      [19]
     </xref>. Biologists working in Hawai’i have suggested that non-native dominance of ichneumonid communities may impact threatened native birds by depleting their prey through parasitism 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Peck2">
      [25]

    <p>In this study we explore whether planting of a dominant native tree species (
     <italic>
      Acacia koa
     </italic>), along with a number of native understory trees and shrubs, yields an ichneumonid wasp fauna resembling communities found in nearby native Hawaiian forest. We investigated an ongoing, large-scale restoration effort in the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge in Hawai’i, focusing on distance to native forest, planting configuration, and time since planting. We frame our habitat restoration study around both native and non-native species to address the following questions: 1) Do Ichneumonidae use reforested 
     <italic>
      A. koa
     </italic> stands?; 2) How do ichneumonid communities in restored habitats compare with those in native forest, the target ecosystem?; and 3) Does ichneumonid community composition, particularly with respect to native species, vary as a function of a) age of planting, b) planting configuration (patches versus corridors), c) distance from native forest, d) surrounding tree cover, or e) components of the understory plant community?</p>

     <p>We sampled ichneumonids in the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (HFNWR), a United States government-owned 10,500 ha reserve on the eastern slope of Hawai’i Island (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059356-g001">

      <italic>
       Metrosideros polymorpha
      </italic> (‘ōhi’a); the understory is comprised mostly of native trees and ferns, with some non-native trees, forbs, and lianas. The remaining 3,500 ha at higher elevations, although originally forested, were cleared for cattle pasture in the early to mid-1800’s and are now dominated by non-native grasses. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acquired this land in 1986, primarily to protect and restore prime habitat for Hawaii’s highly endangered forest bird species. The HFNWR initiated reforestation in former pastureland in 1987

     <title>Habitat Types</title> 
     <p>HFNWR’s reforestation program involved planting primarily koa seedlings. Koa was selected for its rapid growth and ability to survive in high-light, non-forest conditions at high elevations. Planting was conducted in two designs: linear corridors stretching uphill from within the mature forest, and roughly rectangular patches of trees in the middle of pasture. Planting locations were selected without reference to soils or geomorphology (see 
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059356-g001">
       Fig. 1
      </xref>). Since 2003 there has been regular planting of native understory trees and shrubs within these koa corridors and patches. At the time of this study, natural regeneration under planted koa was limited to several fern species (personal observations) and the shrub

     <title>Ichneumonid and Vegetation Sampling</title> 
     <p>We sampled plants and arthropods at HFNWR from June–August 2007 and June–August 2008. We surveyed 12 corridors (four remnant corridors, four young planted corridors, and four old planted corridors), five patches of restored koa, and four grassland sites. We identified suitable replicate corridors and stands using aerial images, historical records, and expert field-based knowledge. The entire study site (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059356-g001">
       Fig. 1
      </xref>) extends about 6 km north-south, and 3 km east-west. All sampling points are between 1,650 and 2,000 m elevation.</p> 
     <p>For each corridor, we surveyed fixed points starting 300 m within the native forest adjacent to the corridor and continuing at 150 m intervals along each corridor’s length. The first points, at 300 m and 150 m inside the native forest, constitute our native forest sampling (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059356-g001">
       Fig. 1
      </xref>). At each patch and grassland site, our goal was to collect a representative sample of wasps from the area. In patches, we determined center points using aerial photographs in a Geographic Information System; we measured the length and width of patches, identified the center point, and subsequently found these points in the field using UTM coordinates. We selected sites for grassland sampling by using these same tools to identify the points on the Refuge furthest from the nearest tree cover. We established survey locations at the patch center or grassland site ‘center’ and 50 m from those points at 0°, 120°, and 240°. We combined data from all four sampling locations in each patch and grassland; we situated survey points in three different directions 50 m away simply as a non-biased method for increasing sampling coverage.</p>

      <title>Ichneumonid sampling</title> 
      <p>We surveyed arthropods using six pan traps at each point. Pan traps were 20-cm-diameter plastic bowls 
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Abrahamczyk1">
        [31]
       </xref>, placed on the ground 1–2 m apart in the vicinity of each sampling point. We used three colors (two blue, two yellow, and two white at each point) to attract a diversity of invertebrates, since species may respond differently to the color spectrum. We filled traps approximately 2/3 full of water; to decrease surface tension we added biodegradable soap (1 ml per liter of water). We left the traps out 24 hours (12 hours of daylight) unless weather conditions during part or all of that time were such that wasps were unlikely to be active (e.g., high humidity or high wind conditions 
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-GonzlezMoreno1">
        [32]
       </xref>). In those cases we left the traps out longer in order to ensure 12 hours of “effective” trapping time. We combined samples from all six traps at each point. We repeated this survey twice in Summer 2007 and three times in Summer 2008, for a total of five summer sampling days at each point.</p>

     <title>Data Analysis</title> 
     <p>We tested the effects of habitat type, surrounding tree cover, and distance to forest on ichneumonids using a number of analyses. First, we compared ichneumonid richness and abundance across habitat types (section 2.4.1). Second, we analyzed ichneumonid community composition variation across habitat types (section 2.4.1). Third, we examined whether three response variables [(a) ichneumonid species richness, (b) native ichneumonid abundance, and (c) the similarity of individual sites to the pooled community of ichneumonids in forest habitats] varied with respect to three explanatory variables [(a) distance to forest, (b) tree cover, and (c) for abundance of native ichneumonids only, the non-koa plant community] (section 2.4.2).</p> 
     <p>We do not consider samples within the same corridor, patch, or grassland independent from one another; nor did we consider the temporal replicates from each point independent.

      <p>We based community similarity tests on Chao similarity coefficients

We also developed a similarity-to-forest index based on Chao similarity coefficients; the index quantifies community composition similarity of each sampling point in the corridors with a set of sampling locations in the target ecosystem (12 points, each 300 m inside the forest edge; see

All response variables exhibited spatial autocorrelation as measured by Moran’s I (Appendix A). The GLMM addressed this autocorrelation by grouping spatially proximate observations (through the specification of corridor as a random effect); sampling points within corridors were not considered independent from one another (spatially or otherwise). Similarly, when all temporal replicates were used in analyses, the GLMM addressed the non-independence of data from the same sampling point (through the specification of sampling point as a random effect). That is, the GLMM approach avoided pseudoreplication by accounting for the non-independence of sampling points while using all spatial and temporal replicates

     <title>Non-native Species and ‘Novel Ecosystems’</title> 
     <p>Given that 96.5% of our ichneumonid samples comprised non-native species, at least the arthropod component of our study area could be considered a novel ecosystem 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Hobbs1">
       [50]
      </xref>. In such novel ecosystems, management approaches that recognize and account for novel species assemblages are needed because complete eradication of non-native species is likely infeasible 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Hobbs2">
       [51]
      </xref>. While most restoration approaches in Hawai’i are attuned to the roles of non-native species, they often lack important knowledge (for example, of population levels and species interactions) that could guide management decisions.</p> 
     <p>Ecological restoration could be considered a sub-field of “intervention ecology,” a moniker alluding to both the human agency in restoration and the unlikelihood, in many circumstances, of fully re-creating a pre-existing system 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Hobbs3">
       [52]
      </xref>. The high proportion of non-native species found in our study begets many questions about restoration trajectories and how human “interventions” impact ecological interactions. In the context of a restoration intervention such as this one, for instance, it is possible that the dominance of non-native species may decline as the ecosystem responds to restoration efforts 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Ruhl1">
       [53]
      </xref>. If and how interactions between native and non-native species change over time in restoration projects, however, are important questions that warrant further inquiry, because detailed information on ecological interactions is often lacking, as it is in our study system. Our analysis did not include lepidopteran larval rearing studies, an important step in determining ichneumonid impact on ecological communities 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Henneman1">
       [26]
      </xref>. Given that HFNWR was created to protect increasingly rare native birds whose diets comprise lepidopteran larvae, and given the overwhelming dominance of non-native Ichneumonidae in this system, such studies are especially important. To add to the complexity, we do not know if the overall abundance of ichneumonids is now higher due to the influx of non-natives. Higher populations would likely negatively impact prey species populations, at least in the short term. Conversely, it is possible that non-native ichneumonids are filling niches left vacant by extirpated or rare native ichneumonid species 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-DAntonio1">

     <title>Patterns Important for Restoration Efforts</title> 
     <p>We found significantly higher abundances and greater species diversity of ichneumonids in planted sites than in adjacent grasslands and in the target ecosystem. We found that ichneumonid communities in all planted sites differed from the target system, which is consistent with many past studies of arthropod communities and restoration, for instance in Wyoming 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Parmenter1">

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Longcore1">
       [9]
      </xref>. Other past research in agricultural landscapes (as opposed to lands undergoing native habitat restoration) has found greater species richness of bees and wasps in agricultural systems than in protected forest 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Schepp1">
       [55]
      </xref>. The consistency of our results with these previous findings leads to questions about the mechanisms underlying higher diversity of arthropod communities in agricultural and restored habitats compared with arthropod communities in native forest.</p> 
     <p>As in other studies 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Grimbacher1">
       [56]
      </xref> investigation of the relationship between different aspects of ichneumonid community composition and site characteristics yields information pertinent to restoration and management. Although plantings had greater overall (native and non-native) ichneumonid abundance and species richness than native forest, the abundance of native ichneumonids did not differ significantly between plantings and native forest. This is an important distinction that is encouraging for native-focused restoration efforts. We found that restoration of native forest may help to increase the abundance of native Ichneumonidae with respect to non-natives. Specifically, we found native ichneumonids only in native habitat and restored areas (not grasslands), and these individuals were more abundant in areas with higher surrounding tree cover. Further studies are needed to explore the effect of restoration on interactions between native and non-native members of this ecological community.</p> 
     <p>In corridors, we found a positive relationship between native ichneumonid abundance and proximity to forest. This result, combined with the lack of a difference in native ichneumonid abundance between forests and planted corridors, confirms that the majority of native ichneumonids in corridors are found closer to the forest. The implication of this finding (that native ichneumonids are venturing from the forest into corridors) is an important consideration for restoration, especially in non-native-dominated systems. This result is consistent with past work, which has found that connectivity to target habitat can increase restoration success 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Woodcock1">
       [57]
      </xref>.</p> 
     <p>We also found that, in corridors, overall tree cover at a relatively fine scale (120 m) is related to the similarity between a given point’s ichneumonid community and the community in the target native forest ecosystem. Research on other highly mobile taxa, such as birds

       [60]
      </xref>, similarly found that total area of native vegetation is a strong determinant of target species presence in restoration sites.</p> 
     <p>These two findings, that ichneumonid communities are related to both proximity to native forest and the proportion of tree cover in the surrounding landscape, are consistent with prior work on the distribution of wasps in heterogeneous human-modified landscapes 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Schepp2">
       [61]
      </xref> and suggest that landscape context is a critical concern for restoration planning 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Lamb1">
       [62]
      </xref>. Our results related to tree cover suggest the importance of trees in particular to ichneumonids. Although we found ichneumonids throughout restoration corridors (up to 1.5 km from native forest), we do not know how far they will fly over non-preferred habitat (in this case, former pastureland) to reach preferred habitat (in this case, trees). Restoration in general should consider that the distance between a restoration site and ‘source’ habitat may be a critical factor for colonization by many taxa, and particularly arthropods 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Debinski1">
       [63]
      </xref>. Other factors, however, may outweigh distance, especially for highly mobile arthropods such as butterflies and moths 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Cunningham1">
       [64]
      </xref>, 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Summerville1">
       [65]
      </xref>. Each species’ colonization ability will interact with distance between habitats, and for arthropods, as with many other taxa, that interaction will be critical to restoration success 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Grimbacher1">
       [56]
      </xref>. Our results do not address these issues directly, but raise important questions for future research.</p> 
     <p>That neither native wasp abundance nor overall community composition differ by age of planting is not surprising given ichneumonids’ mobility 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Nouhuys1">
       [23]
      </xref> and the relative maturity of even our youngest sites. This result nevertheless demonstrates that ichneumonids visit restoration plantings within 10 years (this study does not reveal whether the ichneumonids were feeding, reproducing, or passing through the restoration sites). Although a past study found arthropod communities more similar to the target ecosystem in older plantings (6–17 years as opposed to 2–4 years) 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Grimbacher1">
       [56]
      </xref>, rapid colonization (in &lt;5 years) is possible even for taxa with relatively low mobility, such as wingless arthropods 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Woodcock2">
       [66]
      </xref>. It is possible that plantings in our study are in a slower-growth stage of a non-linear transformation process; that is, major changes may have occurred within the first five years (as in 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Grimbacher1">
       [56]
      </xref>, 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Woodcock2">
       [66]
      </xref>), but subsequent changes (e.g., in years 5–20 after restoration) occur more slowly.</p> 
     <p>Just as age of planting did not seem to impact ichneumonid communities, our results do not suggest that the configuration of planted trees (i.e. patches versus corridors) impacts ichneumonid community composition. This finding is consistent with the scarce past work on arthropods and restoration configurations. Ingham and Samways 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Ingham1">
       [67]

Future research could focus on understanding the potential for certain plant species in this system to facilitate the return of particular invertebrate species, for example through provision of native host insects. Previous work has demonstrated this role for plants in other systems. In one site in southwest Australia, for instance, most restored plant species supported distinct assemblages of hemiptera (‘true bugs’) 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Moir1">
       [68]
      </xref>. In a site in the United Kingdom, insect assemblages in native tree plantations with understory restoration plantings were more similar to target habitat than assemblages in native tree plantations lacking understory plantings

       [69]

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Bangert1">
       [70]
      </xref>. These past findings suggest important considerations for restoration efforts and, combined with our results, inspire questions about plant-arthropod interactions in our study system. For example, does

      <italic>

      <italic>
       P. aquilinum
      </italic>, which spontaneously colonized our study area) associated with factors that make an area less hospitable to native Ichneumonidae?</p>

     <title>Limitations</title> 
     <p>We sampled only in summer months; variations in multiple domains (e.g., floral resource availability; weather) suggest that results could differ with year-round sampling 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Pearson1">
       [71]
      </xref>, 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Poulin1">
       [72]
      </xref>. Inter-annual variation (e.g., droughts or major storm events) could also impact ichneumonid communities 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Ovadia1">
       [73]
      </xref>. Further, findings might well change with a longer temporal scale than our 16-month period. Additional limitations arise from the spatial arrangement of habitat types. Remnant corridors follow gulches, and thus have different geomorphological characteristics than planted corridors. Young planted corridors are all on the northern edge of the study area and grasslands are nearer the western edge of the study area, while the other habitat types are more evenly distributed. We do not perceive these limitations as great because overall biotic and abiotic conditions in the study area are quite similar.</p> 
     <p>An additional limitation may stem from the likely impact of edge effects (the variation in species populations at the nexus of two habitat types separated by an abrupt edge 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Murcia1">
       [74]
      </xref>). Because planted corridors in our study were approximately 40 m wide, entire corridors could be considered edge habitat 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Ries1">
       [75]
      </xref>. While a number of studies have found edge effects for invertebrates between forest and grassland

       [76]
      </xref>,

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Kotze1">
       [78]
      </xref>. Our forest sampling sites that were farthest from an edge were 300 m into the forest; it is possible, and perhaps likely, that edge effects impact these areas as well. One study, for instance, found that edge effects for arthropods (beetles) extended as far as 1 km 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059356-Ewers1">
       [79]
      </xref>. Because all corridors were roughly the same width, the likely effect of habitat edges does not jeopardize our results. As restoration proceeds and the corridors widen and eventually meet, these edge effects will be greatly reduced.</p>

     <title>Conclusions</title> 
     <p>The results of this study can inform restoration action and future restoration research. Although most land stewards do not manage explicitly for ichneumonids, these insects may serve as indicators of various ecological processes

       [24]
      </xref> and may play critical roles in inter-specific interactions such as parasitism. A better understanding of the effects of time, design (corridor or patch), and landscape context (surrounding tree cover and distance from native, mature forest) on these ecologically important organisms will help landowners, public agencies, and conservation organizations to understand more about the benefits of restoration projects to a broad array of species and will aid efforts to maximize the conservation value of planted forests. Our study suggests that restoration plantings attracted native ichneumonids in numbers similar to native forest, and they also attracted a diversity of non-native wasps. Future restoration interventions may consider implementing restoration plantings in areas with higher surrounding tree cover and biotic connections (e.g., corridors) to native forest, and/or 
      <italic>
       creating
      </italic> surrounding tree cover and connections to native forest through restoration plantings, to increase the chance that ichneumonid communities will more closely resemble those of existing native ecosystems. Our findings also reinforce the need for future restoration efforts, especially those in novel ecosystems, to consider the role of non-native species in recently restored ecosystems.</p>
